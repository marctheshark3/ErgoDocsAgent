Product Requirements Document: AI Agent Digital Library
1. Overview
1.1 Purpose
The AI Agent Digital Library is a system to ingest, process, and serve documentation from GitHub repositories (e.g., https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergodocs) and websites, transforming raw data into LLM-optimized and human-readable formats. It leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for dynamic data access, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware responses, and AI agents for automated workflows. The system supports pipelines for document ingestion, updates, research, and validation, enabling a scalable knowledge base for platforms like Open WebUI.
1.2 Objectives

Ingest and Process: Download and parse documentation from GitHub repositories and websites, extracting key information.
Optimize Documentation: Recraft documents into LLM-friendly formats (e.g., structured markdown, summaries, tags) and human-readable formats.
Automated Pipelines:
Ingestion Pipeline: Process new or updated documents.
Update Pipeline: Periodically refresh existing documents.
Research Pipeline: Search for new data based on queries or categories (e.g., "Ergo smart contract repos on GitHub").
Validation Pipeline: Assess document quality and relevance (e.g., verify code functionality).


Scalability and Modularity: Use MCP for dynamic data access and RAG for context-aware LLM responses.
Deployment: Run workflows via Docker Compose, scheduled weekly, using local LLMs (Ollama) or cloud-based models (Anthropic, OpenAI).
Integration: Serve optimized documents to platforms like Open WebUI for LLM and human use.

1.3 Success Metrics

Ingestion Accuracy: 95% of documents parsed correctly without manual intervention.
Document Quality: 90% of recrafted documents rated as "clear and useful" by human reviewers.
Pipeline Reliability: 99% uptime for scheduled workflows.
Query Relevance: 85% of RAG/MCP queries return relevant results (based on user feedback).
Processing Time: Initial ingestion of a repository (e.g., ergodocs) completed within 2 hours.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 System Components

MCP Server: Exposes repository files and metadata as tools/resources for AI agents.
AI Agents: Built using OpenAI’s Agent API, handle ingestion, recrafting, research, and validation tasks.
RAG Pipeline: Integrates with vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB) for semantic search and context augmentation.
Document Store: Stores raw, processed, and metadata files (e.g., MongoDB or filesystem).
Scheduler: Docker Compose with cron jobs for weekly pipeline execution.
LLM Backend: Supports Ollama (local), Anthropic, or OpenAI models.
Frontend Integration: API to serve documents to Open WebUI or similar platforms.

2.2 Pipelines

Ingestion Pipeline:
Download repository (e.g., ergodocs) or scrape website.
Extract text, code, and metadata using parsing tools (e.g., BeautifulSoup, markdown parsers).
Recraft documents into LLM-optimized formats (structured markdown, summaries, tags).
Store in document store and index in vector database.


Update Pipeline:
Check for updates in source repository (e.g., new commits).
Reprocess updated files and refresh vector embeddings.


Research Pipeline:
Accept queries or categories (e.g., "Ergo smart contract repos").
Use GitHub API to search for relevant repositories.
Ingest and process new sources.


Validation Pipeline:
Evaluate document quality (e.g., code functionality, relevance).
Tag documents as "valid," "broken," or "low-quality."
Maintain an index of processed documents with quality metrics.

3. Technical Requirements
3.1 Technology Stack

LLM Backend:
Local: Ollama (e.g., Llama 3.1 for document recrafting).
Cloud: Anthropic (Claude 3.5), OpenAI (GPT-4o).


AI Agents: OpenAI Agent API for workflow orchestration.
MCP Server: Python-based, using Anthropic’s MCP SDK ().
Document Parsing: BeautifulSoup, markdown-it-py, or PyPDF2 for text extraction.
Vector Database: ChromaDB for RAG embeddings.
Document Store: MongoDB for metadata, filesystem for raw/processed files.
Scheduler: Docker Compose with cron jobs for weekly runs.
APIs: GitHub API for research, OpenAI API for agent workflows.
Frontend: REST API to serve documents to Open WebUI.

3.3 Security

MCP Security: Use JSON-RPC over secure channels (HTTP/STDIN) with authentication ().
Data Privacy: Ensure no sensitive data is sent to cloud LLMs without user consent.
Access Control: Restrict MCP server access to authorized agents.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Scalability

Handle up to 10,000 documents initially, with modular pipelines to scale.
Support multiple repositories concurrently via MCP server.

4.2 Performance

Ingestion: Process a medium-sized repo (e.g., ergodocs) in <2 hours.
RAG Queries: Respond to queries in <2 seconds.

4.3 Reliability

Pipelines retry failed tasks up to 3 times.
Maintain document index with 99% consistency.

5. User Stories

As a developer, I want to ingest the ergodocs repo so that I can access optimized documentation in Open WebUI.
As a researcher, I want to query for Ergo smart contract repos so that I can discover new resources.
As an admin, I want weekly pipeline runs so that the library stays up-to-date.
As an LLM user, I want RAG/MCP queries to return relevant, high-quality documents.

6. Risks and Mitigation

Risk: Parsing errors for complex documents.
Mitigation: Use robust parsers and fallback to manual review.


Risk: Outdated documents in RAG.
Mitigation: Run update pipeline weekly and validate embeddings.


Risk: High LLM costs for cloud models.
Mitigation: Prioritize Ollama for local processing, use cloud models selectively.

Week 3-4: Implement research and validation pipelines.
Week 5: Integrate RAG and test with Open WebUI.
Week 6: Deploy Docker Compose and schedule workflows.
Week 7: Test and refine based on user feedback.

8. Future Enhancements

Support for additional sources (e.g., PDFs, forums).
Multi-language document processing.
Advanced validation using code execution sandboxes.
Integration with other agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain).
