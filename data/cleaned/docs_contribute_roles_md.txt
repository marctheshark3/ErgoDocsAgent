# Career Opportunities at Ergo

While the Ergo Foundation does occasionally advertise full-time positions, these roles are often specialized and senior in nature. A more direct pathway to becoming a key member of our team is by engaging with our compensated [bounties](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/). These tasks not only allow you to make substantial contributions to our mission but also provide an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of our platform.

Moreover, active participation in our ecosystem discussions can help you identify areas where your unique skills can have an impact. We value diversity in knowledge and perspectives, not just technical expertise. Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or simply an Ergo enthusiast, your insights can significantly contribute to Ergo's growth and success. This active involvement serves as an excellent stepping stone towards a potential long-term collaboration with us.
