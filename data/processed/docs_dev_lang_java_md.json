  "title": "Java Development with Ergo",
  "summary": "The document provides an introduction to Java development with the Ergo AppKit, which is an essential tool for Java developers creating applications using Ergo. The Ergo AppKit utilizes the capabilities of GraalVM and offers a range of features to streamline the development process. It acts as a compact interface to the core elements of the ErgoScript interpreter and Ergo protocol implementations, enabling Java developers to engage with Ergo's foundational infrastructure without the need to explore the Scala codebase. Alternatively, direct interaction with the core Rust implementation is possible via Java (JNI) bindings for sigma-rust. The document highlights that the Ergo AppKit allows Java developers to focus on crafting innovative applications using Ergo, leveraging the unique features and robust blockchain infrastructure that Ergo provides.",
