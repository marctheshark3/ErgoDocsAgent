  "summary": "Interlink vectors are a fundamental component of the Proof-of-Proof-of-Work (PoPow) protocol in the Ergo blockchain. They allow lightweight clients to efficiently verify the correctness of the blockchain without downloading the entire chain. Interlink vectors create a hierarchical structure by storing references to previous block headers at varying heights, enabling efficient validation and compression of blockchain data. They work in conjunction with Merkle trees and PoPow proofs to ensure the blockchain follows the longest chain rule, which is critical for maintaining the security and integrity of the network. Interlink vectors are essential for enabling efficient and secure blockchain validation in scenarios where full nodes are impractical, supporting the participation of lightweight clients and ensuring the network remains decentralized and accessible. The implementation in Ergo involves recursively hashing previous block headers and updating the interlink vector with each new block, allowing clients to verify the blockchain's integrity by checking only the relevant levels in the interlink vector.",

For lightweight clients, downloading and validating every block in this chain is impractical due to resource constraints. Interlink vectors solve this problem by storing references to previous blocks in a hierarchical manner. This allows clients to verify the chain's integrity by checking only a subset of blocks, drastically reducing the amount of data they need to process.\n\nInterlink vectors are essential for enabling efficient and secure blockchain validation in scenarios where full nodes are impractical.
