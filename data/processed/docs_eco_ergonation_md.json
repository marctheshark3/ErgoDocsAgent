  "summary": "ErgoNation is a community-driven project focused on decentralized identity (\u03a3ID) verification on the Ergo blockchain. It aims to implement the \"one person, one vote\" concept in an anonymous and decentralized manner within the Ergo community. Participants create an Ergo wallet, use ErgoMixer to maintain anonymity, and complete monthly identity verification events to receive a verification code. ErgoNation has no token, treasury, or centralized team, and is dependent on voluntary independent contributors. The project encourages upholding the ideals of crypto, decentralization, and anonymity.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The concept of \"one person, one vote\" is easily achievable through centralized, non-anonymous mechanisms such as nation states distributing IDs. However, this becomes a challenge in an anonymous, decentralized environment. As a result, most crypto projects resort to using tokens for governance, which conceptually resemble stock shares and corporate governance; these follow the principle of \"more investment, more voting power.\" ErgoNation aims to implement the concept of \"one person, one vote\" in an anonymous and decentralized manner within the Ergo community. Projects can then utilize the on-chain \u03a3ID data to create an electoral list."

      "heading": "How Does ErgoNation Work?",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Participants begin by creating a new Ergo wallet and funding it using the ErgoMixer, which helps maintain the participant\u2019s anonymity. Once a month, participants are given an opportunity to complete an identity verification event. These events are designed to ensure that the participating \u03a3IDs are not bots or multi-accounts. In practice, participants are required to complete a short game to receive a verification code. This code is a small user-specific amount of ERG that is sent to a predefined address. The start time of the event, verification codes, and end are all announced on-chain, ensuring the history is verifiable and unchangeable."

      "heading": "ErgoNation Ideals",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "ErgoNation is a community that encourages its members to uphold the ideals of crypto, decentralization, and anonymity. There is no token, no treasury, and no centralized team. This means that the project is entirely dependent on voluntary independent contributors, who can propose to add their work for the community. This also means that individuals are free to contribute work that inspires them, instead of being driven by the commercial pressures of growth and profits."
