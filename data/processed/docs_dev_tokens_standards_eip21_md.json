  "title": "EIP-0021: Genuine Token Verification",
  "summary": "This EIP provides a list of genuine tokens of value on the Ergo blockchain, to help users and applications verify the authenticity of tokens. It outlines a process for adding tokens to the list, and recommends approaches for applications to handle verified, suspicious, and blocked tokens, using specific visual indicators. The motivation is to address the problem of users receiving tokens with the same name as genuine tokens, which could be used for scams.",
  "qa_pairs": [
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of EIP-0021?",
      "answer": "EIP-0021 lists the common tokens of value with their unique identifier, so users as well as wallet and explorer applications can verify if a token is genuine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important to verify the authenticity of Ergo tokens?",
      "answer": "Ergo tokens can be minted by every user, with a name and description free to choose, so it's important to verify if a token is genuine to avoid issues."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are Ergo tokens identified?",
      "answer": "The unique identifier of an Ergo token is the identifier of the first input box of the transaction that created the token."
    },
    {
      "question": "What property of the hash function used for Ergo tokens ensures uniqueness?",
      "answer": "The hash function used is collision-resistant, so there's no chance to have a second token with the same identifier."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the background information provided about Ergo tokens?",
      "answer": "Ergo supports custom tokens as first-class citizens, and a transaction can create out-of-thin-air tokens in its outputs if the token identifier is equal to the identifier of the first input box."
