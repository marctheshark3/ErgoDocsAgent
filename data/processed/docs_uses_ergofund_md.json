  "summary": "ErgoFund will eventually provide a more sophisticated crowdfunding experience, with contracts for campaigns with thousands of pledges and enable Self-Soverign DeFi. The design of the crowdfunding contracts and box templates is centred around blockchain scanning efficiency of an off-chain application. The ErgoFund backend will be built on top of the Scanner. A simple ErgoFund contract with an interactive scastie playground is available. The pledge contract supports ANY recipient contract, so it would be possible to crowdfund to a threshold sig address (controlled via Zero-Knowledge treasury), or emission. There is also an Ergo Crowdfunding CLI, a command-line tool enabling participation and interacting with crowdfunding campaigns on Ergo.",
