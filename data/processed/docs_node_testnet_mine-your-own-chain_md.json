Modifying the configuration file (testnet.conf) to set a unique address prefix and custom magic bytes to avoid conflicts with the Ergo mainnet and public testnet.\n2. Compiling the Ergo node using the sbt assembly command.\n3. Running the node with the custom configuration.\n4. Initializing and unlocking the wallet through the web panel.\nThe document also provides community support channels for further assistance with deeper modifications.",

This will help prevent address clashes with the mainnet and public testnet by using a custom `addressPrefix` and `magicBytes`.\n\n2. **Compile the Node:**\n\n    - Use the following command to compile the Ergo node:\n      ```shell\n      sbt assembly\n      ```\n    - This will generate an `ergo.jar` file at `/target/scala*/ergo-*.jar`.\n\n3. **Run the Node:**\n\n    - Start the node using the command:\n      ```bash\n      java -jar -Xmx4G ergo-*.jar --testnet -c testnet.conf\n      ```\n\n4. **Initialize and Unlock the Wallet:**\n\n    - Access the panel at `127.0.0.1:9052/panel` to initialize and unlock your wallet. This is necessary as the first blocks will be generated using Autolykos v1."
