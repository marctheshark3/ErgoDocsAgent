  "title": "How to Spend an Expired Ergo Box",
  "summary": "This document provides a detailed guide on how to spend an expired Ergo box. It outlines the specific conditions that must be met, including the required storage fee duration, the use of an empty spending proof, and the integration with the storage rent mechanism. The document also includes code snippets and references to the relevant Ergo platform components, such as the ErgoInterpreter and the MiningCore integration. Additionally, it covers the storage rent-specific handling, including querying the storage rent endpoint, integration with mining pools, and the implementation in the ErgoClient. The summary emphasizes the importance of these updates in ensuring the efficient processing of expired Ergo boxes while adhering to the storage rent policies, maintaining the blockchain's sustainability and efficiency.",

      "question": "What is the minimum storage fee duration required to spend an expired Ergo box?",
      "answer": "The box must have been retained for at least the designated storage fee period, as validated by calculating the difference between the height of the upcoming block and the creation height of the box."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the requirement for the spending proof when spending an expired Ergo box?",
      "answer": "The spending proof for the expired box must be empty, meaning that no cryptographic validation is needed to authorize its spending."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you check if an expired Ergo box is affected by storage rent?",
      "answer": "The storage rent endpoint must be queried to ensure compliance with Ergo's storage rent rules."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the code snippet to verify the storage fee duration for an expired Ergo box?",
      "answer": "context.preHeader.height - context.self.creationHeight >= Constants.StoragePeriod"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of waiving the cryptographic authorization requirement for spending an expired Ergo box?",
      "answer": "It allows any participant to spend the expired box without needing to prove ownership, as long as the storage fee duration condition is fulfilled."

This is validated by calculating the difference between the height of the upcoming block, as indicated in the preheader, and the creation height of the box. This difference should be greater than or equal to the storage fee period.\n2. **Spending Proof**: For an expired box, the spending proof must be left empty, eliminating the need for cryptographic authorization for the box's spending.\n3. **Storage Rent Awareness**: If the expired box is affected by storage rent, it must be processed through the appropriate storage rent mechanism. The storage rent endpoint must be queried to ensure compliance with Ergo\u2019s storage rent rules."

The spending proof for the expired box must be empty, meaning that no cryptographic validation is needed to authorize its spending. This allows any participant to spend the expired box without needing to prove ownership, as long as the storage fee duration condition is fulfilled."

To do so, one needs to provide an index of a newly recreated box (or an index of any box, if the expired box lacks sufficient funds for the storage fee) in the context extension variable #127, which will be stored as part of the input."
