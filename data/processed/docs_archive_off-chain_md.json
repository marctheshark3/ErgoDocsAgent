  "summary": "This document explores the role of off-chain components in the Ergo blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It discusses the distinction between on-chain and off-chain elements, highlighting the importance of off-chain systems like watchers, oracles, and bots in enhancing the capabilities of on-chain processes. The document provides a case study of a transaction bot, details the off-chain services supporting ErgoDex, and explains the role of watchers in the Rosen Bridge. It also covers the requirements and rewards for becoming a watcher or an oracle provider on the Ergo network.",

These include smart contracts associated with boxes and the data within the registers of those boxes. The typical development flow of a dApp begins with the creation of transactions, followed by crafting smart contracts to facilitate the dApp's decentralized functionality on the blockchain.\n\nIn contrast, off-chain elements refer to the components of a dApp that operate outside the blockchain. Systems are needed to process Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTxOs) and advance them through the stages of a dApp's lifecycle. Off-chain systems often encompass REST endpoints and bots that execute several vital tasks, such as:\n\n- Retrieving data from the blockchain\n- Composing transactions for user signatures\n- Processing transactions poised for the next phase in the dApp's workflow"
