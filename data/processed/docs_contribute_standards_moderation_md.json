It enables server administrators to set up automated rules and filters to moderate content, user behavior, and server activity. With Automod, you can:\n\n- Filter and block specific words, phrases, or links\n- Automatically delete messages containing prohibited content\n- Warn or kick/ban users for violating server rules\n- Set up whitelists and blacklists for channels, roles, or users\n- Customize responses and actions for different rule violations\n\nTo configure Automod, navigate to the server settings and select the \"Safety Setup\" tab, then select 'Edit' on \"AutoMod\". From there, you can create new rules, define triggers (words, phrases, links, etc.), and specify the desired actions (delete message, warn user, kick/ban, etc.). Automod rules can be as simple or complex as needed, allowing for granular control over server moderation.\n\n\n/// admonition | Exclude members based on activity\n    type: warning\n\nThe spam rules are designed to be strict to catch potential abuse. However, this can sometimes lead to false positives for legitimate messages. To mitigate this issue, certain roles are excluded from the spam filters on the Ergo Discord server. \n\nOne approach is to use a service like [engau.ge](https://engau.ge/) to assign new users a specific role once they reach a threshold number of messages. This role can then be excluded from the spam rules, allowing more active and engaged members to participate freely without triggering false positives.\n///"
