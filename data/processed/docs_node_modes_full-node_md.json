  "summary": "Full-Node Mode refers to two different modes of operation for a node in the Bitcoin network:\n\n1. Full 'Archival' Node Mode: This is the standard mode, similar to a full Bitcoin node.\n\n2. Pruned-Fullnode Mode: Downloads all headers, validates proofs-of-work, and links structures, followed by downloading a UTXO snapshot from peers and the full blocks succeeding it.",
