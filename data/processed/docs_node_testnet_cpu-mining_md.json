Make sure your wallet is initialized and unlocked. You should see mining activity in the node's output.\n\nYour rewards will be sent to your rewardPublicKey, which is different from your wallet address. You can use testnet.sigmaexplorer.org to monitor miner distribution, hashrate, and difficulty.",
