  "title": "Merkle Tree Format in Ergo",
  "summary": "The document provides an overview of the Merkle Tree format used in the Ergo blockchain. It explains the structure of the Merkle Tree, including leaf nodes, internal nodes, and the Merkle Root. The leaf nodes represent transaction hashes and spending proofs, while internal nodes are constructed by hashing the concatenation of their child nodes. The Merkle Root serves as a cryptographic commitment to the entire dataset. The document also covers the encoding of Merkle proofs, which allow efficient verification of data integrity. It includes references to the relevant code implementations in the Ergo and Scrypto repositories.",

Leaf nodes represent the hash of individual data elements, such as transactions, while non-leaf nodes represent the hash of their child nodes. The topmost node, known as the Merkle Root, serves as a cryptographic commitment to the entire dataset. This structure allows for efficient verification of data integrity, ensuring that even if only a small portion of the data is checked, the entire dataset can be trusted.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A1[Transaction Hash 1] --> B1[Hash 1]\n    A2[Transaction Hash 2] --> B1\n    A3[Transaction Hash 3] --> B2[Hash 2]\n    A4[Transaction Hash 4] --> B2\n    B1 --> C[Parent Hash 1]\n    B2 --> C\n    C --> D[Merkle Root]\n```"

The prefix for a leaf node is `0x00`. This data is then hashed using the `Blake2b256` hash function.\n\n- **Code Reference**: The implementation of leaf node hashing can be found in the [MerkleTree.scala](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto/blob/master/shared/src/main/scala/scorex/crypto/authds/merkle/MerkleTree.scala) file in the `scrypto` repository."

A Merkle proof provides the necessary data to verify that a particular leaf node is part of the Merkle Tree.\n\nThe encoding consists of the following elements:\n\n1. **1-byte prefix**: Indicates whether the computed value (hash) is on the right (`0x01`) or the left (`0x00`) side of the node.\n2. **32-byte stored value**: This is the sibling hash for the current node. The proof provides the path of sibling hashes from the leaf to the root, allowing the verifier to recompute the root hash.\n\nWhen verifying a proof, the verifier reconstructs the path from the leaf node to the Merkle Root using the provided sibling hashes and the original leaf hash. If the computed root matches the expected Merkle Root, the proof is valid.\n\n- **Code Reference**: The `BatchMerkleProof` class, handling Merkle proof generation and verification, is implemented in the [BatchMerkleProof.scala](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto/blob/master/shared/src/main/scala/scorex/crypto/authds/merkle/BatchMerkleProof.scala) file."
