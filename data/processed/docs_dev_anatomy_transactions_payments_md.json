ErgoPay can connect any wallet with any dApp, while a web dApp connector is limited to web extension wallets and website dApps. As a dApp developer, you may need to run part of your logic on a server that can be accessed by user's wallet applications, which doesn't necessarily complicate things as you can choose the language and framework that best suits your needs.",

ErgoPay can connect any wallet with any dApp, while a web dApp connector is limited to web extension wallets and website dApps.

For a website dApp, this means that some of your code needs to live on your backend. This doesn\u2019t necessarily complicate things. In fact, on the backend, you aren\u2019t restricted to using JavaScript or its derivatives. You are free to choose the language and framework that best suits your needs."
