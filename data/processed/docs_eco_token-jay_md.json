      "content": "1. Visit [TokenJay](http://tokenjay.app)\n2. Connect your wallet by scanning the QR code\n3. Navigate to 'Your Token Sales'\n4. Click 'Start New Sale'\n5. Select the vesting key from your wallet\n6. Enter the buyer's address\n7. Set the price the buyer should pay (in $ per SPF token, converted into Erg)\n8. Click 'Sell Token'\n9. Sign the transaction\n\nOnce the transaction is confirmed, the buyer can make the purchase via TokenJay. The offer will appear under 'P2P Escrow offers'. The buyer should verify the token and minting transaction to ensure its authenticity. If it's an Ergopad vesting key, they can verify the tokenid in the verifier API:\n\n[https://api.ergopad.io/vesting/vestedWithKey/tokenid](https://api.ergopad.io/vesting/vestedWithKey/tokenid)\n\nThis will return whether it is a real key, the token type, and the number of tokens. If everything checks out, they can click 'Buy' and sign the transaction.\n\nOnce the transaction is processed, the Erg is sent to the seller, the key is sent to the buyer, and the contract takes a small fee.\n\nFor more information, visit [https://tokenjay.app/escrow.html](https://tokenjay.app/escrow.html)"
