  "summary": "ErgoUtils now supports obfuscating entry points for ErgoMixer to improve privacy. When withdrawing from the mixer to a wallet, it is obvious that the person has received funds from the mixer. This tool allows creating obfuscating addresses that randomly route the funds through multiple addresses before reaching the user's wallet, making it harder to identify the mixer usage. The document provides an example transaction demonstrating the effectiveness of this feature, which is freely available in the ErgoUtils open-source project.",

This tool is designed to address this issue.\n\nJust create an (or more if you wish) obfuscating address with your desired hop number [here](https://ergoutils.org/#/others) and use it permanently. To use it, withdraw from the mixer to the address that is created for you; your received funds in that address will automatically go through some random addresses (randomly created outputs, both number of outputs and output amounts) and finally be received in your wallet.\n\nAs an example, try to figure out if this [transaction](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/transactions/9cf412c71fc49a53f7f6ae498f22730be474127436334e5a38da92ce0d40530b) is from the mixer or not - a lot harder to figure out.\n\nAs always, utilities in ErgoUtils are completely free to use!\n\n- [ergoutils GitHub](https://github.com/anon-real/ergoutils)\n- [mixerHop.js](https://github.com/anon-real/ErgoUtils/blob/master/src/utils/mixerHop.js)"
