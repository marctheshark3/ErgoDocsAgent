      "content": "Since its early days, Bitcoin[@Nak08] has allowed more than simple money transfers between two public keys: its Bitcoin Script scripting language has allowed participants to specify conditions for how money could be spent. A program written in Bitcoin Script is attached to every transaction output (i.e., amount received); this program protects the transaction by determining how the transaction output can be used as an input to (i.e., spent in) a future transaction. The simplest condition is specified by a program that contains the recipient's public key and states that the money can be spent by creating a signature that verifies under this key. However, more general conditions are allowed by more sophisticated programs.\n\nThe Bitcoin Script language is a primitive stack-based language without loops[@bscript]. To spend an output protected by a program, a spending transaction must provide a program in the same language, and the concatenation of the two programs must evaluate to *true*. The creator of the spending transaction can be viewed as a prover (for example, proving knowledge of the secret key by producing a signature), where the statement that needs to be proven is specified by the output that is being spent. Transaction validity is verified by evaluating programs. Bounded validation time is ensured by the absence of loops in the programming language and a maximum program size of 10 kilobytes. Even so, some denial-of-service attacks exploiting script validation time have appeared [@bitcoindos] [@fivehrs] [@ethattacks]. On the other hand, the deliberate simplicity of the programming language limits the kinds of contracts that can be created on the Bitcoin platform.\n\nOn other end of the generality spectrum, Ethereum allows for arbitrary Turing-complete programs[@wood2014ethereum]. This approach requires charging for computation, in order to prevent denial-of-service attacks, because the running time of a Turing-complete program cannot, in general, be estimated without actually running the program. It is also needed in this case to have gas limit per block, otherwise, DoS is possible anyway, for example, a miner can do attack the network for free.\n\nA variety of cryptocurrency languages have appeared. We do not survey them here, but refer the reader to Scilla[@Scilla], Simplicity[@o2017simplicity], Marlowe[@seijas2018marlowe], TypeCoin[@crary2015peer], and many other languages."

In fact, given a program in $\\langname$, it is easy to obtain an estimate of its running time.

      "content": "Our new language incorporates proving and verifying as first-class primitives, giving developers access to a subclass of cryptographic proof systems known as non-interactive $\\Sigma$-protocols (pronounced \"sigma-protocols\"). Thus, a script protecting a transaction output can contain statements ($\\Sigma$-statements) that need to be proven (by producing $\\Sigma$-proofs) in order to spend the output.\n\nConceptually, $\\Sigma$-proofs [@Cra96] are generalizations[@CL06] of digital signatures. In fact, Schnorr signature scheme[@Sch91] (whose more recent version is popularly known as EdDSA [@BDLSY12,@rfc8032]) is the canonical example of a $\\Sigma$-proof: it proves that the recipient knows the discrete logarithm of the public key (the proof is attached to a specific message, such as a particular transaction, and thus becomes a signature on the message; all $\\Sigma$-proofs described here are attached to specific messages). $\\Sigma$-protocols exist for proving a variety of properties and, importantly for $\\langname$, elementary $\\Sigma$-protocols can be combined into more sophisticated ones using the techniques of [@CDS94]. For an introduction to $\\Sigma$-protocols, we refer the reader to [@Dam10] and [@HL10].\n\n$\\langname$ provides two elementary $\\Sigma$-protocols over a group of prime order (such as an elliptic curve), written here in multiplicative notation:\n\n* A proof of knowledge of discrete logarithm with respect to a fixed group generator: given a group element $h$, the proof convinces a verifier that the prover knows $w$ such that $h=g^w$, where $g$ is the group generator (also known as base point), without revealing $w$. This is the same as a Schnorr signature with public key $h$.\n* A proof that of equality of discrete logarithms (i.e., a proof of a Diffie-Hellman tuple): given group elements $g_1, g_2, u_1, u_2$, the proof convinces a verifier that the prover knows $w$ such that $u_1=g_1^w$ and $u_2=g_2^w$, without revealing $w$\n\n$\\langname$ also provides the ability to build more sophisticated $\\Sigma$-protocols by using connectives $\\andnode$, $\\ornode$, and $\\tnode$ (also known as $k$-out-of-$n$). Crucially, the proof for an $\\ornode$ and a $\\tnode$ connective does not reveal which of the relevant values the prover knows: for example, in $\\langname$ a ring signature by public keys $h_1, \\dots, h_n$ can be specified as an $\\ornode$ of $\\Sigma$-protocols for proving knowledge of discrete logarithms of $h_1, \\dots, h_n$. The proof can be constructed with the knowledge of just one such discrete logarithm, and does not reveal which one was used in its construction.\n\nOur implementation of these protocols is in Scala [@scala] and Java [@java]. The implementation was informed by SCAPI [@scapi], but does not use SCAPI code. We use Bouncy Castle [@bouncycastle] for big integer and elliptic curve operations; the implementation of arithmetic in fields of characteristic 2 (for $\\tnode$ connectives) is our own."

      "content": "The language syntax is a subset of Scala with the same meaning, and therefore many of the constructs are easy to read for those familiar with Scala.\n\nBefore we describe the language, let us fix some terminology. A *box* (often called a \"coin\" in other literature) contains some amount (*value*, measured in Ergo tokens) and is protected by a *script* (boxes also contain additional information, such as other tokens; this information is described in detail in [Section Box Registers](#box-registers-and-additional-tokens)). A *transaction* spends the value of boxes that are its *inputs* (which are outputs of some earlier transaction) and produces boxes that are its *outputs*. In a given transaction, the sum of the values of the inputs must equal the sum of the values of the outputs (as we describe below, the scripting language is rich enough to allow for payment transactions fees and for minting of new coins without violating this rule).\n\nAll the unspent transaction outputs (*UTXO*) at a given time represent the value stored in the blockchain. A script for a box must evaluate to \"true\" when this box is used as an input to a transaction. This evaluation is helped by a *proof* (for $\\Sigma$-statements) and a *context*, which are part of the transaction. The proof is produced by someone who knows the relevant secrets, such as secret keys; the context contains information about the spending transaction, such as details of its inputs and outputs, and the current state of the blockchain, such as the current height of the blockchain and last 10 block headers from the blockchain."

If the variable $\\texttt{pk}$holds the public key, then this script is specified simply as a string\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n        pk\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn order for the compiler to know what value the variable $\\texttt{pk}$ is referring to, the compiler needs to be supplied with an *environment*, which, in this case, is a single-element map, mapping the string $\\texttt{\"pk\"}$to the object holding the public key.\\footnote{This map is an object in Scala, and is passed to the compiler as a parameter together with the script (which is passed in as a string) when the compiler is invoked from within Scala code. We defer the discussion of how to invoke the compiler outside of Scala code to another article.\n\nThe value of public key is hardwired into the script at compile time, thus $\\texttt{\"pk\"}$ can also be called *named constant* to reflect the fact that it cannot change. When the script is later evaluated (i.e., when the box is used as a transaction input), a $\\Sigma$-proof of knowledge of the corresponding secret key must be supplied by the prover.\n\nA slightly more complex script may allow either one of two people to spend an box. If Alice owns public key $\\texttt{pkA}$ and Bob owns public key $\\texttt{pkB}$(with corresponding secret key $\\texttt{skA}$ and $\\texttt{skB}), then the script that would allow either one of them to spend the box is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n        pkA || pkB\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAgain, $\\texttt{pkA}$ and $\\texttt{pkB}$need to be mapped to public key objects by an environment map.\n\nNote that Alice and Bob individually can construct the proof necessary to spend this box using just one of the two corresponding secret keys, and, by the zero-knowledge property of $\\Sigma$-protocols, the proof will not reveal whether $\\texttt{skA}$or $\\texttt{skB}$ was used. This construct is known as a *ring* signature.\n\nNaturally, this approach can be extended to more than two keys. If Carol's public and secret keys are $\\texttt{pkC}$ and $\\texttt{skC}$, then a three-key ring signature can be similarly constructed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n        pkA || pkB || pkC\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor syntactic convenience, multiple keys can be placed into a collection, and $\\texttt{anyOf}$ operator can be used instead of $\\texttt{||}$, as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n        anyOf (Coll (pkA, pkB, pkC))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nA conjunction is also possible: the script\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n        pkA && pkB\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nrequires Alice and Bob to use secret keys corresponding to $\\texttt{pkA}$ and $\\texttt{pkB}$ in order to spend the box. Note that Alice and Bob will have to communicate to produce the proof: separate signatures by Alice and Bob will not be sufficient (but Alice and Bob will not have to reveal their secret keys to each other; see Section~\\ref{sec:proving}). Similarly to $\\texttt{||}$, multiple $\\texttt{\\&\\&}$ can be used in sequence, and the operator $\\texttt{allOf}$ can be used for collections.\n\n\nUsing these operators, it is possible to produce more sophisticated scripts. For example, here is a script stating that the box can be spent either by Carol or by a collaboration between Alice and Bob:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n        (pkA && pkB) || pkC\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\nA valid proof (contained in the spending transaction) will not reveal which of two possibilities was used.\n\nOperators $\\texttt{allOf}$ and $\\texttt{anyOf}$ are actually special cases of the operator $\\texttt{atLeast(bound, collection)}$, which requires the prover to know secrets for $\\texttt{bound}$ elements of the $\\texttt{collection}$ (just in like in $\\texttt{anyOf}$, which secrets the prover used will not be revealed by the proof). $\\texttt{allOf(collection)}$ is the same as $\\texttt{atLeast(collection.size, collection)}$ and $\\texttt{anyOf(collection)}$ is the same as $\\texttt{atLeast(1, collection)}$.\n\nFor example, here is a script stating that the box can be spent by any 3 out of the following 6 possibilities: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David and Edie, Frank and George, Helen and Irene:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n        atLeast(3, Coll (pkA, pkB, pkC, pkD && pkE, pkF && pkG, pkH && pkI))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe same result could be achieved by writing an $\\texttt{anyOf}$ of all possible 3-out-of-6 (twenty) combinations."

      "content": "$\\langname$ allows combining statements that require proofs with other boolean statements. These statements can refer to the *context*, which has predefined variables with information about the transaction in which the script is evaluated (i.e., the box is spent). For example,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n   pkA || pkB || (pkC && HEIGHT > 500)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nuses the predefined variable HEIGHT, which is the sequential block number (since the beginning of the blockchain, starting at 1) of the block in which the script is evaluated. This script allows Alice or Bob to spend the box before $\\texttt{HEIGHT}$ reaches 501, and Alice, Bob, or Carol to spend the box after that. If the height has not reached 501 and the box is spent, then the proof reveals that $\\texttt{skA}$ or $\\texttt{skB}$ was used in its construction, but does not reveal which one of the two. If $\\texttt{HEIGHT}$ is greater than 500, then the proof does not reveal which of the three secret keys was used. Thus, depending on the value of $\\texttt{HEIGHT}$, the script becomes either equivalent to $\\texttt{pkA || pkB}$ or equivalent to $\\texttt{pkA || pkB || pkC}$.\n\nIn general, script evaluation reduces the script to a $\\Sigma$-statement by first evaluating all the Boolean predicates that are not $\\Sigma$-statements. As we saw in the above example, the resulting $\\Sigma$-statement will, in general, depend on the values of the Boolean predicates (such as whether $\\texttt{HEIGHT > 500}$).\n\nWe emphasize that this evaluation is not the same as the usual left-to-right lazy evaluation of logical expressions, because expressions involving $\\Sigma$-statements are not treated the same way as usual boolean expressions: they are evaluated last and in zero-knowledge.\n\nIn fact, $\\texttt{pkA}$ is not of type $\\texttt{Boolean}$. It is a constant of type $\\texttt{SigmaProp}$ with the concrete value $\\texttt{ProveDlog(\\texttt{ge})}$, for some public key $\\texttt{ge}$ of $\\texttt{GroupElement}$ type. The type $\\texttt{SigmaProp}$ is special in $\\langname$ because it is used differently by the prover (who constructs the proof) and the verifier (who checks it). In this case $\\texttt{ProveDlog}$ require: \n\n1. the prover (when the transaction is created) to provide a proof of knowledge of the discrete logarithm corresponding to the value $\\texttt{ge}$; \n2. the verifier (when the transaction is added to a block) to check that the proof was indeed provided."

He creates a transaction in Alice's blockchain with an output box protected by the following script:\n\n```scala\n        val x = getVar[Coll[Byte]](1).get\n        anyOf( Coll(\n                HEIGHT > deadlineAlice && pkB,\n                allOf( Coll(\n                        pkA,\n                        x.size < 33,\n                        blake2b256(x) == hx\n                ))\n        ))\n```\n\n\nIf Alice is satisfied with the amount Bob is giving her, she claims the value of this box by revealing $\\texttt{x}$. Alice is protected as long as the hash function is one-way and she keeps her $\\texttt{x}$ secret until she claims the value of this box. (She should be careful to submit her transaction in enough time before $\\texttt{deadlineAlice}$to make sure it gets processed before Bob can reclaim this money, because once she submits the transaction, $\\texttt{x}$is public and thus, if the $\\texttt{deadlineAlice}$passes before the transaction is processed, Bob can both reclaim this box and claim the box Alice left in his blockchain.)\n\nBob is protected, because in order for Alice to claim the value of this box, she must present a hash preimage of $\\texttt{hx}$ as a context extension in the transaction that uses this box as input. But once she does, Bob also learns this hash preimage, and is able to claim the value of the box that Alice placed into his blockchain. Note that Bob needs to choose $\\texttt{deadlineAlice}$ early enough to make sure that he is able to learn the preimage of $\\texttt{hx}$ from the transaction in Alice's block chain, and create a transaction in his blockchain, all before $\\texttt{deadlineBob}$ that Alice chose. Note also that $\\texttt{HEIGHT}$ in the two scripts is with respect to two different blockchains, which may be growing at a different rate. Bob also needs to make sure that he can use Alice's $\\texttt{x}$ as a context extension; to make sure Alice cannot cheat by making this $\\texttt{x}$ so long that it will not be allowed as a context extension in his blockchain, he uses the constraint $\\texttt{x.size < 33}$.\n\nThe same approach can be used to trade different assets on the same blockchain, in case of multi-assets blockchains. However, for transactions on a single blockchain, an alternative approach is also possible. We describe it below."

      "content": "Context variables are passed at box spending time whereas registers at box creation time. Together with its value and protecting script, a box can contain up to 10 numbered registers, $\\texttt{R0}$ through $\\texttt{R9}$. The first four of these have fixed meaning, as follows. For a box $\\texttt{b}$, $\\texttt{b.R0}$ is the same as $\\texttt{b.value}$ and $\\texttt{b.R1}$ is the same as $\\texttt{b.propositionBytes}$.\n\n\nThe third register, $\\texttt{b.R2}$, specifies additional, secondary tokens contained in the box, while the primary token amount is specified in $\\texttt{b.value}$. $\\texttt{b.R2}$ holds a collection of pairs, where each pair's first element specifies the token id (as a collection of 32 bytes) and the second element specifies the amount (as a long value). The maximum number of tokens in a box is limited to 4. For every token id, the sum of amounts in input boxes must be at least equal to the sum of amounts in output boxes. An exception to this rule exists for the creation of new tokens. When a new token type is created in a transaction, its id is set to the id of input box 0. Therefore, the exception for new token creation is that if the token id in an output box matches the id of input box 0, an arbitrary amount of this token can be output. Since each box has a unique id (see [Section~\\ref{sec:context}](#accessing-the-context-and-box-contents)), this exception can be applied exactly once per token type. A newly created token can be emitted in a time-controlled manner\u2014see [this](#self-replicating-code).\n\nThe fourth register, $\\texttt{b.R3}$, contains a pair of integer and 34-byte collection (its type then is $\\texttt{(Int, Coll[Byte])}$). The collection specifies the 32-byte unique transaction id where this box appears as an output followed by a 2-byte sequence number of this box in the $\\texttt{OUTPUTS}$ collection of that transaction. This ensures that each box has unique $\\texttt{R3}$ and therefore a unique $\\texttt{id}$ as long as there are no hash collisions (because the $\\texttt{id}$ of the box is computed by hashing its content, including $\\texttt{R3}$).\n\nThe first element of the pair contains creation height provided by user created the box. This height could only be less or equal than real inclusion height (a transaction could not be included into the blockchain if it contains an output with creation height being no greater than current blockchain height).\n\n(a transaction could not be included into the blockchain if it contains an output with creation height being no greater than current blockchain height).\n\nThe remaining six registers can be used arbitrarily.\n\nTo access a register, the type of the register needs to be specified in brackets following the register number (for example, $\\texttt{b.R4[Int]}$). Note that $\\texttt{b.R4[T]}$ is of type $\\texttt{Option[T]}$; $\\texttt{b.R4[T].isDefined}$ indicates whether it actually contains a value of type $\\texttt{T}$, and $\\texttt{b.R4[T].get}$ obtains this value.\n\nIn addition to registers, scripts can access two serialized versions of the box: $\\texttt{b.bytes}$ is a serialization of the entire box including all its registers, and $\\texttt{b.bytesWithNoRef}, which the same but without the transaction identifier and the output index (so that a box can be viewed independently of where it appeared)."

Consider, for example, Alice and Bob who want to exchange tokens: they agree that Bob will give Alice 60 tokens of type $\\texttt{token1}$ (this type is mapped to an actual token id in the environment map) in exchange for 100 Ergo tokens. Alice could create an output box with value 100 and protect it with the following script:\n\n```scala\n  (HEIGHT > deadline && pkA) || {\n    val tokenData = OUTPUTS(0).R2[Coll[(Coll[Byte], Long)]].get(0)\n    allOf(Coll(\n        tokenData._1 == token1,\n        tokenData._2 >= 60L,\n        OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes == pkA.propBytes,\n        OUTPUTS(0).R4[Coll[Byte]].get == SELF.id\n    ))\n  }\n```\n\n\nThis script ensures that the box can be spent only in a transaction that produces an output with 60 tokens of type $\\texttt{token1}$ and gives them to Alice (Alice can reclaim the box after the deadline).\nMoreover, the last condition ($\\texttt{OUTPUTS(0).R4[Col[Byte]].get == SELF.id}$) ensures that if Alice has multiple such boxes outstanding at a given time, each will produce a separate output that identifies the corresponding input. This condition prevents the following attack: if Alice has two such boxes outstanding but the last condition is not present, then they can be both used in a single transaction that contains just one output with 60 tokens of type $\\texttt{token1}$--- the script of each input box will be individually satisfied, but Alice will get less only half of what owed to her.\n\nBob, similarly, could create an output box with value about 0 and 60 tokens of type $\\texttt{token1}$ and protect it by the following script:\n\n```scala\n        &(HEIGHT > deadline && pkB) ||\n        &allOf( Coll(\n        &        OUTPUTS(1).value >= 100L,\n        &        OUTPUTS(1).propositionBytes == pkB.propBytes,\n        &        OUTPUTS(1).R4[Coll[Byte]].get == SELF.id,\n        & ))\n```\n\nA transaction containing these two boxes as inputs must produce two outputs: the first giving at least 60 tokens of type1 to Alice and the second giving at least 100 tokens of type2 to Bob. Once the two boxes are on the blockchain, anyone can create such a transaction using the two boxes as inputs, and thus effect the exchange between Alice and Bob. Unlike the cross-chain trading example above using hashing (which requires one side to go first), there are no potential problems with synchronization here, because the exchange will happen in a single transaction or will not happen at all."

This value will go down by a prespecified amount each time this box is transacted.

The box is set up to allow the difference to go to anyone---presumably, it will be claimed by the miner who created the block that contains the transaction.

      "content": "In this section, we explain in detail how the $\\Sigma$-protocol proving and verifying is implemented. Consider the tree after the evaluation process, as described in Section~\\ref{sec:impl}, reduces it to only $\\Sigma$-protocol nodes. Then the leaves of the tree are atomic $\\Sigma$-protocols, and non-leaves are of one of three types: $\\andnode$ (corresponding to $\\texttt{\\&\\&}$ or $\\texttt{allOf}$ in $\\langname$), $\\ornode$ (corresponding to $\\texttt{||}$or $\\texttt{anyOf}$in $\\langname$), or $\\tnode(k)$ (corresponding to $\\texttt{atLeast}$ in $\\langname$).\n\nThe meaning of the proof corresponding to $\\tnode(k)$ is *the prover knows witnesses for at least $k$ children of this node*. Semantically, $\\andnode$ and $\\ornode$ are simply special cases of $\\tnode$: the meaning  of the proof corresponding $\\andnode$ (respectively, $\\ornode)$ is *the prover knows witnesses for all children (respectively, at least one child) of this node*. However, $\\andnode$ and $\\ornode$ are implemented differently from $\\tnode$ for efficiency.\n\nFor the purposes of this description, it does not matter what specific atomic $\\Sigma$-protocols are used at the leaves. They can be, for example, $\\texttt{proveDlog(x)}$ for proving knowledge of the discrete logarithm $w$ of $x=g^w$, or $\\texttt{proveDHtuple(g1, g2, u1, u2)}$ for proving that $(g_1, g_2, u_1, u_2)$ form a Diffie-Hellman tuple, i.e., $\\exists w \\mbox{\\ such\\  that\\ }$u_1 = g_1^w \\, \\wedge \\, u_2 = g_2^w$. In general, we will assume the prover has some secret $w$ and wants to prove some property of it.\n\nA $\\Sigma$-protocol consist of three messages:\n\n- a *commitment* $a$ sent from the Prover to the Verifier (computed using the witness $w$ and some freshly generated secret randomness $r$ by the Prover's first step algorithm);\n- a uniformly random *challenge* $e$ sent from the Verifier to the Prover;\n- and a *response* $z$ sent from the Prover to the Verifier (computed using the randomness $r$, the challenge $e$, and the witness $w$ by the Prover's second step algorithm).\nThe verifier then checks that the triple $(a, e, z)$ satisfies some formula and, if so, accepts the proof.\n\nIn order to make an atomic $\\Sigma$-protocol non-interactive using the so-called Fiat-Shamir heuristic, the Prover would compute $e$ by hashing $a$, and the Verifier would check that $e$ is indeed a hash of $a$. However, once atomic $\\Sigma$-protocols are composed using $\\andnode$, $\\ornode$, and $\\tnode$, the challenge computation becomes more involved, as we describe below.\n\n$\\Sigma$-protocols have the property of *special honest-verifier zero-knowledge*. For the purposes of this description, it means that given a random $e$, it is possible to compute $a$ and $z$ without knowing the secret witness $w$ that is normally needed by the prover. This computation is called *simulation*. Moreover, the triple $(a, e, z)$  computed via simulation is distributed identically to the triple $(a, e, z)$ that results form a $\\Sigma$-protocol that is run by the honest prover (who knows the secret witness $w$) and verifier (who generates a uniform $e$). The trick that makes simulation possible is that the response $z$ is chosen by the simulator before commitment $a$, in contrast to the prover, who is forced to choose $a$ before $z$.\n\n$\\Sigma$-protocols used in this work must also satisfy a property of *special soundness*, which means that given two triples $(a_1, e_1, z_1)$ and $(a_2, e_2, z_2)$ that are both accepted by the verifier, and $a_1=a_2$ while $e_1\\neq e_2$, it is possible to compute the Prover's secret witness $w$ in polynomial time and thus directly verify that the statement claimed by the Prover is true.   Note that this computation is never performed, because the Prover will never actually answer two different challenges $e_1\\neq e_2$ for the same commitment $a_1=a_2$.\n\nIn order for composition of $\\Sigma$-protocols using $\\andnode$, $\\ornode$, and $\\tnode$ to work, the challenge $e$ in all protocols must be a binary string of the same length, which we will call $t$.  (This implies that if the Verifier performs arithmetic modulo $q$ on $e$, then $2^t<q$; else it would be trivial to have $e_1\\neq e_2$ by letting $e_2=e_1+q$, and the same $z$ would work for both $e_1$ and $e_2$, violating the special soundness property mentioned above, because such $a, e_1, z$ can be computed without knowledge of the witness $w$ by using the simulator.)  Note that $t$ is the *soundness parameter*: the probability that a malicious Prover can fool the Verifier in a single attempt is $2^{-t}$.\n\nFor ease of description, we will also impose the following limitation on the $\\Sigma$-protocols: in the interactive version, the verification code must proceed by computing $a'$ from $z$ and $e$, and then checking if $a'=a$. That means that in the noninteractive version, the Prover needs to transmit only $z$ and $e$ (omitting $a$) to the Verifier, who will compute $a'$ from $z$ and $e$ and then check that $e$ was computed correctly as a function of $a'$. If the hashing is second-preimage-resistant, an incorrect $a'$ will lead to a mismatch of $e$, which will be detected by the Verifier. This limitation is satisfied by most common $\\Sigma$-protocols; it is not essential and can be removed by having the Prover additionally send $a$.\n\nWe show the steps of the prover and verifier given such a tree. While $\\andnode$, $\\ornode$, and $\\tnode$ composition of $\\Sigma$-protocols has been addressed in the literature before [@CDS94}, prover and verifier algorithms have been described only for a single node, in terms of prover, verifier, and simulator algorithms for its children. Recursively constructing code for an entire tree by dynamically constructing prover, verifier, and simulator code for each node is inefficient. Here we take a different approach by explicitly describing how and in what order the protocol messages for each node of the tree need to be computed and verified. We are not aware of any similar descriptions in the literature.\n\nOur description uses two kinds of tree traversal: bottom-up (also known as post-order) and top-down (also known as preorder). In a bottom-up traversal, for each node, operations are recursively applied to the children of the node before being applied to the node itself. In a top-down traversal, for each node, operations are applied to the node itself before being recursively applied to each of its children."

If timing attacks are a concern, it is not enough to make sure that simulation and proving take a similar amount of time for each atomic $\\Sigma$-protocol used in the leaves; implementations should also make sure that tree traversals take the same amount of time regardless of where simulated and real $\\Sigma$ protocols are located in the tree.

      "content": "For each node in the tree, the prover will maintain a flag indicating whether it is real or simulated. Each node will also have a $t$-bit challenge. The leaves will additionally have two protocol values: a challenge and a response. The pseudocode below explains how these values are computed. In the pseudocode below, the word *random* should be read to also allow securely generated pseudorandom values.\n\n\nThe prover first has to decide which nodes will have real proofs (for which witnesses are required) and which will be simulated. For example, in an $\\ornode$ proof, only one of the children will be real. The prover will do so based on witnesses that are available, in three steps:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\label{step:initial-simulated}$This step will mark as *real* every node for which the prover can produce a real proof. This step may mark as *real* more nodes than necessary if the prover has more than the minimal necessary number of witnesses (for example, more than one child of an $\\ornode$).  This will be corrected in the next step. In a bottom-up traversal of the tree, do the following for each node:\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item If the node is a leaf, mark it *real* if the witness for it is available; else mark it *simulated*\n            \\item If the node is $\\ornode$, mark it *real* if at least one child is marked real; else mark it *simulated*\n            \\item If the node is $\\andnode$, mark it *real* if all of its children are marked real; else mark it *simulated*\n            \\item If the node is $\\tnode(k)$, mark it *real* if at least $k$ of its children are marked real; else mark it *simulated*\n        \\end{itemize}\n\n    \\item If the root of the tree is marked *simulated* then the prover does not have enough witnesses to perform the proof. Abort.\n\n    \\item This step will change some *real* nodes to *simulated* to make sure each node has the right number of simulated children.\n          In a top-down traversal of the tree, do the following for each node:\n        \\begin{itemize}\n            \\item\n            If the node is $\\ornode$ marked *real*,  mark all but one of its children *simulated*\n            (the node is guaranteed by step~\\ref{step:initial-simulated}$to have at least one *real* child).\n            Which particular child is left *real* is not important for security; the choice can be guided by efficiency or convenience considerations.\n            \\item\n            If  the node is $\\tnode(k)$ marked *real*, mark all but $k$ of its children *simulated*\n            (the node is guaranteed, by the previous step, to have at least $k$ *real* children).\n            Which particular ones are left *real* is not important for security; the choice can be guided by efficiency or convenience considerations.\n            \\item\n            If the node is marked *simulated*, mark all of its children *simulated*\n        \\end{itemize}\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\noindent\nNow the prover will compute protocol values for every node, as follows:\n\n1. In a top-down traversal of the tree, compute the challenges $e$ for simulated children of every node, as follows:\n    - If the node is marked \"real\", then each of its simulated children gets a fresh uniformly random challenge in $\\{0,1\\}^t$. (Note that a real $\\andnode$ node has no simulated children, so this step applies only to real $\\ornode$ and $\\tnode$ nodes.)\n    - If the node is marked \"simulated\", let $e_0$ be the challenge computed for it. All of its children are simulated, and thus we compute challenges for all of them, as follows:\n        - If the node is $\\andnode$, then all of its children get $e_0$ as the challenge.\n        - If the node is $\\ornode$, then each of its children except one gets a fresh uniformly random challenge in $\\{0,1\\}^t$. The remaining child gets a challenge computed as an XOR of the challenges of all the other children and $e_0$.\n        - If the node is $\\tnode(k)$, assume it has $n$ children numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are two possible algorithms. The first algorithm is faster than the second. However, it is also faster than the algorithm for a \"real\" $\\tnode$ node; therefore, if a timing attack on the prover is a possibility, then it should not be used, because the timing attack may be able to distinguish a \"real\" $\\tnode$ node from a \"simulated\" one.\n            1. The faster algorithm is as follows. Pick $n-k$ fresh uniformly random values $q_1, \\dots, q_{n-k}$ from $\\{0,1\\}^t$ and let $q_0=e_0$. Viewing $1, 2, \\dots, n$ and $q_0, \\dots, q_{n-k}$ as elements of $\\GF(2^t)$, evaluate the polynomial $Q(x) = \\sum {q_i x^i}$ over $\\GF(2^t)$ at points $1, 2, \\dots, n$ to get challenges for child $1, 2, \\dots, n$, respectively.\n            2. The algorithm with better resistance to timing attacks is as follows. Pick $n-k$ fresh uniformly random values $e_1, \\dots, e_{n-k}$ as challenges for the children number $1, \\dots, n-k$. Let $i_0 = 0$. Viewing $0, 1, 2, \\dots, n$ and $e_0, \\dots, e_{n-k}$ as elements of $\\GF(2^t)$, find (via polynomial interpolation) the lowest-degree polynomial $Q(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-k}$a_i x^i$ over $\\GF(2^t)$ that is equal to $e_j$ at $j$ for each $j$ from $0$ to $n-k$ (this polynomial will have $n-k+1$ coefficients, and the lowest coefficient will be $e_0$). Set the challenge at child $j$ for $n-k<j\\le n$ to equal $Q(j)$.\n\n2. For every leaf marked \"simulated\", use the simulator of the $\\Sigma$-protocol for that leaf to compute the commitment $a$ and the response $z$, given the challenge $e$ that is already stored in the leaf.\n\n3. For every leaf marked \"real\", use the first prover step of the $\\Sigma$-protocol for that leaf to compute the necessary randomness $r$ and the commitment $a$. In case of multiple provers responsible for different leaves, each prover individually computes the randomness $r$ for that leaf; the provers send their commitments $a$ to the main prover (note that the existence of this communication, if observed by the adversary, will reveal to the adversary which leaves are real).\n\n4. Convert the tree to a string $s$ for input to the Fiat-Shamir hash function. The conversion should be such that the tree can be unambiguously parsed and restored given the string. For each non-leaf node, the string should contain its type ($\\andnode$, $\\ornode$, or $\\tnode(k)$). For each leaf node, the string should contain the $\\Sigma$-protocol statement being proven and the commitment. The string should not contain information on whether a node is marked \"real\" or \"simulated\", and should not contain challenges, responses, or the real/simulated flag for any node.\n\n5. Compute the challenge for the root of the tree as the Fiat-Shamir hash of $s$ (and, if applicable, the associated data, such as the message being signed).\n\n6. Perform a top-down traversal of only the portion of the tree marked \"real\" in order to compute the challenge $e$ for every node marked \"real\" below the root and, additionally, the response $z$ for every leaf marked \"real\" (note that nodes marked \"simulated\" have all their descendants marked \"simulated\" and all the challenges for these descendants already computed, so there is no need to recurse down \"simulated\" nodes, unless timing attacks are a concern). For every node, do the following:\n    - If the node is a non-leaf marked \"real\" whose challenge is $e_0$, proceed as follows:\n        - If the node is $\\andnode$, let each of its children have the challenge $e_0$.\n        - If the node is $\\ornode$, it has only one child marked \"real\". Let this child have the challenge equal to the XOR of the challenges of all the other children and $e_0$.\n        - If the node is $\\tnode(k)$, number its children from $1$ to $n$. Let $i_1, \\dots, i_{n-k}$ be the indices of the children marked \"simulated\" and $e_1, \\dots, e_{n-k}$ be their corresponding challenges. Let $i_0 = 0$. Viewing $0, 1, 2, \\dots, n$ and $e_0, \\dots, e_{n-k}$ as elements of $\\GF(2^t)$, find (via polynomial interpolation) the lowest-degree polynomial $Q(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-k}$a_i x^i$ over $\\GF(2^t)$ that is equal to $e_j$ at $i_j$ for each $j$ from $0$ to $n-k$ (this polynomial will have $n-k+1$ coefficients, and the lowest coefficient will be $e_0$). For child number $i$ of the node, if the child is marked \"real\", compute its challenge as $Q(i)$ (if the child is marked \"simulated\", its challenge is already $Q(i)$, by construction of $Q$).\n    - If the node is a leaf marked \"real\", compute its response $z$ according to the second prover step of the $\\Sigma$-protocol given the randomness $r$ used for the commitment $a$, the challenge $e$, and witness $w$. In case of multiple provers, the main prover will send the relevant challenges to other provers, who will respond with the relevant $z$. It is crucial for security that the provers do not respond to more than one challenge $e$ for a given commitment $a$. Again, like in Step 3, the mere existence of this communication reveals which leaves are real and which are simulated. Moreover, if the main prover chooses the challenge $e$ maliciously for another prover, the zero-knowledge property of the other prover's secret is not preserved (although, for most $\\Sigma$-protocols, no useful information about the other prover's secret will be revealed for any, even maliciously chosen, $e$; but a malicious choice of $e$ may make side-channel attacks easier).\n\n7. Output the proof consisting of the following information:\n    - The challenge of the root node.\n    - For every $\\ornode$ node: the challenges of all of its children but the rightmost.\n    - For every $\\tnode$ node: the coefficients $q_1 \\dots q_{n-k}$ of the polynomial $Q(x)$ (excluding $a_0$).\n    - The responses for every leaf node."

Finally, verifier will hash the whole tree and will check that the hash value matches the challenge of the root node.\n\nNote that, unlike the prover, the verifier has no way of knowing which nodes are real and which are simulated. In fact, making sure that the verifier cannot tell the difference between real and simulated nodes is one of the security goals of the protocol.\n\nThe pseudocode below details the verifier's steps.\n1. Read the root challenge from in the proof.\n\n2.

For the example~\\ref{eq:example1}$the tree would be as following:\n\n<!-- \\knote{draw the tree}. \n\nIf the tree is well-formed according to the typing rules, and also has complexity no more than an allowed limit, interpreter is going to rewrite it, in potentially many steps. For every step, the interpreter tries, going from bottom to top of the tree, to replace nodes which are ready to be transformed~(operands are in place, and the transformation itself is known). The next step is about the same transformations in the same bottom-top order to be done. The process finishes in one of the following cases:\n\n- **abort:** happens if transformation process by its complexity exceeds an upper bound. The complexity estimation works as follows. The interpreter remembers initial cumulative complexity $C_0$, and for each replacement in the tree it calculates cumulative complexity of a subtree to be inserted instead of a subtree to be removed $\\Delta C$, and adds $\\Delta C$ to current cumulative complexity $C$, where $C = C_0$ initially.\n\n- **success:** we finish with this status if during last step there are no any transformations done.\n\nIf the transformations are finishing with abortion, the result is considered as $false$ (we recall that the interpreter is giving a single boolean result finally, whether an output could be spent or not). Otherwise, if the tree could not be transformed anymore the interpreter is looking into it. If the tree is about just a single node which contains boolean constant value~($true$ or $false$), the value is the result of the interpretation. If the tree contains statements not provable via $\\Sigma$-protocols, the interpreter finishes with $false$. Otherwise, if the tree contains only statements provable via $\\Sigma$-protocols, the interpreter is continuing to work, and here execution is different for the prover and the verifier. The prover is generating a proof for the statement by using its secrets, as described in Section~\\ref{sec:proving}, and the verifier checks the statement against the proof~(provided in a spending transaction), as described in Section~\\ref{sec:verifying}. The verifier outputs $true$ if the proof is valid for the statement, $false$ otherwise.

Thus there is no need for knowledge of an arbitrary output. To show the coin of the weather service in the spending transaction, outputs from Alice and Bob are referencing to the coin by using Merkle proofs against UTXO set root hash of the latest known block.\n\nA tricky moment is how Alice and Bob can be sure that a coin is indeed created by the service, having just the coin (and also service's public key x = $g^w$, where service's secret w is not known.\n\nFor that, we consider that the service creates a coin with registers of following semantics (R0 and R1 are standard):\n\nR1 - coin amount\nR2 - protecting script, which is the pubkey of the service, $x = g^w$\nR3 - temperature data, number\nR4 - $a = g^r$, where r is secret random nonce\nR5 - $z = r + ew mod q$\nR6 - timestamp\n\nThen Alice and Bob are requiring from the coin that the following equation holds: $g^z = a * x^e$, where $e = hash(R3 ++ R6)$\n\nThus Alice, for example, is created a coin with the following statement (we skip timeouts for simplicity):\n\"the coin is spendable by presenting a proof of Alice's private key knowledge if against UTXO set root hash for\nthe last known block there is a coin along with a Merkle proof, for which following requirements hold:\n$R2 = dlog(x) /\\ g^(R5) = R4 * x^(hash(R3 ++ R6)) /\\ (R3) > 15$.
