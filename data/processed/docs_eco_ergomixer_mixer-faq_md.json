  "summary": "The document provides a comparison between Tornado Cash and ErgoMixer, highlighting the key differences between the two privacy-focused mixers. ErgoMixer is built on the Ergo blockchain and offers features like ring signatures, Covert Addresses, Stealth Addresses, and SigmaUSD minting, in addition to avoiding the risks associated with the multi-party computation setup required for Tornado Cash's zk-SNARKs. The document also discusses ErgoMixer's focus on decentralization and measures to prevent blacklisting and tracking, as well as its self-hosted and anonymous developer nature.",

Potential risks if participants collaborate to generate fake proofs. | No \"ceremony\" setup required. Avoids risks associated with MPC setup. |\n| Decentralization | Operates on Ethereum; potential for centralization due to congestion, centralsied block production. | Focuses on decentralization to enhance privacy, discourages centralization tendencies. Incorporates innovative design for programmable money which enables a *programmable* mixer |\n| Blacklisting/Tracking | Vulnerable to blacklisting/tracking due to Proof-of-Stake. | Implements measures to prevent blacklisting/tracking, encourages node decentralization. |\n| Hosting and Developer | Developed by a known team. | Self-hosted and created by an anonymous developer. Adds an additional layer of privacy and security. |\n\n\nTornado.Cash uses `zk-SNARKs`, which requires a \"ceremony\" to generate parameters required by the zk-SNARKs algorithm itself. This  Multi-party-computation means if only one participant of the MPC setup was honest, all others could try to cheat, and it would be secure. \n\nHowever, if all participants cheated and cooperated, they would have the ability to generate fake proofs later, and nobody will know about it.\n\nIn the specific case of tornado cash, it would mean that if all of the 1114 ceremony setup participants cheated, they could generate fake proofs and drain money from the tornado.cash smart contract.\n\nHowever, if only one of them were honest, it would be secure for people to use.\n\nErgoMixer doesn't require this \"ceremony\" setup.\n\nThe computer where the MPC ceremony holds place should also be secure and destroyed after the ceremony. Otherwise, it could leak keys that a malicious attack can use to construct fake proofs. There's a really strong game theoric incentive to integrate some backdoor to the software or even hardware of MPC computer."
