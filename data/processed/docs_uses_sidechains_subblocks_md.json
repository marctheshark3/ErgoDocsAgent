  "title": "Subblocks in Ergo",
  "summary": "Ergo has introduced sub-blocks (input blocks) and ordering blocks, reducing typical onchain confirmation times from 2 minutes to 2 seconds, a 17x improvement. Sub-blocks are block candidates generated with lower difficulty, allowing faster transaction propagation and confirmation. Ordering blocks maintain the overall consensus and security of the blockchain. These changes provide users with near-instant confirmations and faster failure detection, transforming the mempool into a more cooperative environment and offering a smoother, more efficient experience on the Ergo network.",

    {
      "question": "What are sub-blocks (input blocks) in Ergo?",
      "answer": "Sub-blocks (input blocks) are block candidates generated with a lower difficulty threshold than full blocks. They are produced approximately once per second and carry most transaction data, allowing transactions to propagate and confirm much faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are ordering blocks in Ergo?",
      "answer": "Ordering blocks are the traditional full blocks of Ergo's proof-of-work system. They are generated roughly every 2 minutes and maintain the overall consensus and security of the blockchain."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do sub-blocks (input blocks) and ordering blocks improve the user experience on the Ergo network?",
      "answer": "The introduction of sub-blocks (input blocks) and ordering blocks significantly improves transaction processing speed and reliability, providing users with near-instant confirmations and faster failure detection, thereby offering a smoother and more efficient experience on the network."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the new sub-block (input block) and ordering block design transform the Ergo mempool?",
      "answer": "The new design transforms the mempool from a competitive (PvP) environment into a cooperative, multiplayer-like system, enhancing overall network responsiveness."
