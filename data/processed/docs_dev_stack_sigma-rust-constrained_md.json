  "title": "Using Sigma-Rust in Resource-Constrained Environments",
  "summary": "This document provides guidance on using the Sigma-Rust library in resource-constrained environments, such as hardware wallets or embedded systems. It outlines the challenges, including code size, memory usage, lack of standard library support, and crypto dependencies. The solutions and approaches discussed include using the Sigma-Rust-Mini fork, manually configuring Sigma-Rust for no_std builds, and replacing the cryptographic backend from k256 to secp256k1. The document also highlights potential pitfalls, such as global allocator issues, dependency management, and thorough testing on the target platform. The overall goal is to enable the use of Sigma-Rust in resource-constrained environments while addressing the unique requirements and limitations of these environments.",

      "heading": "3. Replacing the Cryptographic Backend (`k256` -> `secp256k1`)",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "*   **Problem:** The default `k256` crate used by `sigma-rust` for elliptic curve operations can be large or have `std`-dependent features. Hardware wallets often use the more lightweight, C-based `secp256k1` library (via the `secp256k1` Rust crate).\n*   **Solution:** Modify `sigma-rust` (or `sigma-rust-mini`) to use the `secp256k1` crate as the backend for cryptographic operations instead of `k256`.\n*   **Implementation Steps (High-Level):**\n    1.  **Dependency Change:** Replace `k256` with `secp256k1` in `Cargo.toml`, ensuring `no_std` compatibility if needed (the `secp256k1` crate often requires specific feature flags for `no_std`).\n    2.  **Code Adaptation:** Search the codebase for usages of `k256` types and functions and replace them with their `secp256k1` equivalents. Key areas include:\n        *   **Secret Key / Private Key:** `k256::SecretKey` -> `secp256k1::SecretKey`.\n        *   **Public Key:** `k256::PublicKey` -> `secp256k1::PublicKey`.\n        *   **Signature:** `k256::ecdsa::Signature` -> `secp256k1::ecdsa::Signature`.\n        *   **Key Generation:** Random key generation might need adaptation.\n        *   **Signing/Verification:** Use the signing/verification methods from the `secp256k1` crate.\n        *   **Point Operations:** Operations like point multiplication (`mul_tweak`) or addition (`combine`) needed for Diffie-Hellman proofs or signature aggregation must use the `secp256k1` crate's functions. (Refer to the [`secp256k1` crate documentation](https://docs.rs/secp256k1/latest/secp256k1/) for specific methods).\n    3.  **Feature Flags:** Ensure appropriate feature flags are enabled for both `sigma-rust` and `secp256k1` to support the required operations in a `no_std` context.\n*   **Community Hints (from Keystone Integration):** Developers integrating with Keystone hardware wallets successfully used this approach, specifically mentioning the need to map types like `SecretKey`, `PublicKey` and use methods like `mul_tweak` and `combine` from the `secp256k1` crate."

    {
      "heading": "Potential Pitfalls",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "*   **`global_allocator`:** In `no_std` environments that still require dynamic allocation (`alloc`), you need to define a global allocator. Issues can arise if multiple dependencies try to define conflicting allocators.\n*   **Dependency Hell:** Ensuring all transitive dependencies are `no_std` compatible can be challenging. Use tools like `cargo tree` to inspect dependencies.\n*   **Feature Creep:** Be mindful of enabling features in `sigma-rust` or its dependencies that might pull in `std` unexpectedly. Start with minimal features and add only what is necessary.\n*   **API Differences:** The `k256` and `secp256k1` crates have different APIs. The replacement requires careful code changes, not just type renaming.\n*   **Testing:** Thoroughly test the modified library on the target hardware or emulator, paying close attention to cryptographic operations and memory usage."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "Adapting `sigma-rust` for resource-constrained environments is feasible but requires careful planning. Starting with `sigma-rust-mini` is often the recommended approach. If modifications are needed, replacing the cryptographic backend with the `secp256k1` crate is a common and necessary step, particularly for hardware wallet integration. Always prioritize thorough testing on the target platform."
