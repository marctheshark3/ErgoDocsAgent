      "level": 3,
      "content": "We will create a simple console application (called [FreezeCoin](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples/blob/master/java-examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/examples/FreezeCoin.java)) in Java which uses the Appkit library. By using Appkit, we will be able to easily send a new transaction to an Ergo node programmatically. The\ntransaction will transfer a given amount of Erg into a new box protected by the following Ergo contract written in ErgoScript (see this [introduction](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf) and more [advanced examples](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/AdvancedErgoScriptTutorial.pdf) to learn more about ErgoScript).\n\n```java\n// Freezer Contract\n{ \n  // Parameters\n  // freezeDeadline: Int - some future block number after which the box can be spent\n  // ownerPk: SigmaProp - public key of the new box owner\n  sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline) && ownerPk\n}\n```\n\nIn short, a box (and therefore the funds within the box) are locked under a contract (or script) on the Ergo blockchain. In order for the box to be spent, the contract must evaluate to be true. Thus the individual who wishes to spend the box must ensure that the contract evaluates to true based on the encoded logic within it.\n\nOur Freezer contract above checks the following conditions before allowing the box to be spent:\n\n1. The current block number of the Ergo blockchain (aka blockchain HEIGHT) is \ngreater than the specified deadline\n\n2. The spending transaction must be signed by the owner of the secret key\ncorresponding to the ownerPk public key.\n\nThe first condition forbids anyone from spending the box before the Ergo\nblockchain grows to the given height. Because new blocks on the blockchain are mined approximately every 2 minutes on average, using the current\nblockchain height, it is easy to define any duration of delays we wish, such as 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. _(i.e. (60 / 2) * 24 * 7 = 5040, which is the # of blocks per week)_.\n\nWe will now be going in-depth on how we can take this Freezer Contract and integrate it with the Apkit library in order to create the FreezeCoin console application so that anyone and everyone can choose to freeze their coins if they so wish. (Granted, this contract/dApp is not useful; however, it is an effective, simple example for displaying how this technology stack works so that you can build useful dApps down the line.)"

      "level": 3,
      "content": "Appkit aims to provide a set of interfaces that can be used idiomatically in Java. You will feel right at home using Appkit if you are a Java veteran.\n\nPlease follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit#setup) for GraalVM and Appkit if you wish to reproduce the examples below.\n\nTo use Appkit in our Java implementation of FreezeCoin, we must add the following dependency in the [gradle file](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples/blob/master/java-examples/build.gradle.kts)\n\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"org.ergoplatform\", \"ergo-appkit_2.12\", \"3.1.0\", \"compile\")\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nFurthermore, at runtime, Appkit/our application needs to connect with an Ergo Node via REST API. Often,\nthe node will be running locally and made available at `http://localhost:9052/`. This is the standard scenario for anyone who has set up a full-node by following [these\ninstructions](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node) and is using the default configuration.\n\nHenceforth we will assume that you have set up and started your Ergo Node so that it is available for testing of the application.\n\nNext, our application will need to know how to be able to connect to our local running node, in addition to other various settings, in order to function properly. We will use a JSON file with the following\nconfiguration parameters which our FreezeCoin app will load at startup. \n\n[freeze_coin_config.json:](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples/blob/master/freeze_coin_config.json)\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"node\": {\n    \"nodeApi\": {\n      \"apiUrl\": \"http://localhost:9052/\",\n      \"apiKey\": \"put your secret apiKey generated during node setup here\"\n    },\n    \"wallet\": {\n      \"mnemonic\": \"the mnemonic key used to initialize or restore the wallet of the node\",\n      \"password\": \"the password you chose to protect the wallet\",\n      \"mnemonicPassword\": \"the password you chose to protect the mnemonic\"\n    },\n    \"networkType\": \"TESTNET\"\n  },\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"newBoxSpendingDelay\": \"30\",\n    \"ownerAddress\": \"3WzR39tWQ5cxxWWX6ys7wNdJKLijPeyaKgx72uqg9FJRBCdZPovL\"\n  }\n}\n```\nHere `apiKey` is the secret key required for API authentication, which can be\nacquired as described\n[here](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Ergo-REST-API#setting-an-api-key).\nYour mnemonic is the secret phrase obtained during [setup of a new\nwallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Wallet-documentation).\n\nHow our app will work is that the user will launch it from the command line and provide one argument. This argument is the amount of value (in NanoErgs) which they wish to freeze/lock under the Freezer contract which we wrote above.\n\nOur first step for our FreezeCoin app will be to read the configuration JSON file we just created and to accept the command line argument from the user:\n\n```java\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    long amountToSend = Long.parseLong(args[0]);  // positive value in NanoErg\n    ErgoToolConfig conf = ErgoToolConfig.load(\"freeze_coin_config.json\");\n    // the rest of the code discussed below \n    ...\n}\n```\n\nWith these acquired, we can now obtain the spending delay and the owner address, which were defined in the JSON config file.\n\n```java\n  int newBoxSpendingDelay = Integer.parseInt(conf.getParameters().get(\"newBoxSpendingDelay\"));\n  Address ownerAddress = Address.create(conf.getParameters().get(\"ownerAddress\"));\n```\n\nNext, we need to connect to the running Ergo node from our Java application so that we can use the data we just parsed and post something on-chain. This is done by creating\nan `ErgoClient` instance that uses our pre-defined values for our node from the JSON config file as well.\n\n```java\nErgoNodeConfig nodeConf = conf.getNode();\nErgoClient ergoClient = RestApiErgoClient.create(nodeConf);\n```\n\nNow that we have an instance of [ErgoClient](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit/blob/master/lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ErgoClient.java),\nwe can execute any block of code and have access to the current blockchain context.\n\n```java\nString txJson = ergoClient.execute((BlockchainContext ctx) -> {\n    // use ctx here to create and sign a new transaction\n    // then send it to the node \n});\n```\n\nThe lambda passed to `execute` is called when the current blockchain context\nis loaded from the Ergo node. In this lambda, we\nshall put our application logic. \n\nFirst, we start with some auxiliary steps.\n\n```java\n// access the wallet embedded in the Ergo node \n// (using the wallet specified via mnemonic we put in freeze_coin_config.json)\nErgoWallet wallet = ctx.getWallet();\n\n// calculate total amount of NanoErgs we need to send to the new box \n// including paying for transaction fees\nlong totalToSpend = amountToSend + Parameters.MinFee;\n\n// request for unspent boxes that cover the required amount of NanoErgs from the wallet\nOptional<List<InputBox>> boxes = wallet.getUnspentBoxes(totalToSpend);\nif (!boxes.isPresent())\n    throw new ErgoClientException(\n        \"Not enough coins in your specified wallet to pay \" + totalToSpend, null);\n    \n// create a \"prover\", which is a special object that will be used for signing the transaction\n// the prover should be configured with your wallet's secrets, which are necessary to generate signatures (aka proofs)\nErgoProver prover = ctx.newProverBuilder()\n    .withMnemonic(\n            nodeConf.getWallet().getMnemonic(),\n            nodeConf.getWallet().getPassword())\n    .build();\n```\n\nAt this point, we have the input boxes chosen for our spending transaction, but we now need to create an output box with the specified `amountToSend` and locked under the Freezer contract.\n\n```java\n// the only way to create a transaction is using the tx builder obtained from the context\n// the builder uses the context to access necessary blockchain data.\nUnsignedTransactionBuilder txB = ctx.newTxBuilder();\n\n// create new box using new builder obtained from the transaction builder\n// in this case we compile a new ErgoContract from the Freezer ErgoScript code\nOutBox newBox = txB.outBoxBuilder()\n        .value(amountToPay)\n        .contract(ctx.compileContract(\n                ConstantsBuilder.create()\n                        .item(\"freezeDeadline\", ctx.getHeight() + newBoxSpendingDelay)\n                        .item(\"ownerPk\", ownerAddress.getPublicKey())\n                        .build(),\n                \"{ sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline) && ownerPk }\"))\n        .build();\n```\n\nNote, in order to compile `ErgoContract` from the Freezer script source code, the `compileContract`\nthe method requires that we provide values for named constants that are used within the script.\nIf no such constants are used, then `ConstantsBuilder.empty()` can be passed to it.\n\nIn this case, we pass the public key of the new box owner into the `ownerPk` \nplaceholder in the script. To repeat from earlier, this means that the box can only be spent by the owner of the\ncorresponding secret key. \n\nNext, we create an unsigned transaction using all the data we've put together thus far.\n\n```java\n// provide the transaction builder with which boxes we are going to spend, which outputs\n// should be created, the total transaction fees, and the address for change to be sent to\nUnsignedTransaction tx = txB.boxesToSpend(boxes.get())\n        .outputs(newBox)\n        .fee(Parameters.MinFee)\n        .sendChangeTo(prover.getP2PKAddress())\n        .build();\n```\n\nAnd finally we:\n\n1. Use the prover to sign the built transaction\n2. Thus, obtain a `SignedTransaction` instance\n3. Use the blockchain context to send the signed transaction to\nthe Ergo node. \n\nThe resulting `txId` can be used to refer to this transaction\nlater however we do not use it here.\n```java\nSignedTransaction signed = prover.sign(tx);\nString txId = ctx.sendTransaction(signed);\nreturn signed.toJson(true);\n```\n\nAs you may have noticed, for our final step, we show off that it is possible to serialize the signed\ntransaction into a JSON string with pretty-printing turned on. Look at the [full\nsource code](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples/blob/master/java-examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/examples/FreezeCoin.java)\nof the example for more details and for using it as a template in your own\napplication.\n\n---\n\nNow with all of the code set in stone, we can run our FreezeCoin application using the following steps.\n(assuming you are in the directory where you cloned\n[ergo-appkit-examples](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples)).\n\n```shell\n$ pwd\nthe/directory/you/cloned/ergo-appkit-examples\n$ ./gradlew clean shadowJar \n```\nThis will assemble the `build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar` file containing\nour FreezeCoin Java application and all of its dependencies in a single fat jar. \nNote, this step has to be repeated after any changes are made to the Java source code of our application.\n\nHaving created our application, we can now use our FreezeCoin app:\n\n```shell\n$ java -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\\n      org.ergoplatform.appkit.examples.FreezeCoin  1000000000 \n```\n\nYou will get something along the lines of this [output in the console](https://gist.github.com/aslesarenko/cacee372350458ac31bd5c73e957e322).\n\nAnd with that, your transaction was accepted by the Ergo node and broadcast into the network where it shall lay await in the transaction pool to be added to a block. Once a miner selects and adds it to a block, your coins will be officially \"frozen\" within the newly created box based on the values you provided to the FreezeCoin application.\n\nThe example assumes the Ergo node (and the embedded wallet) is owned by the\nFreezeCoin user. However, this is not strictly required, and the Appkit interfaces\ncan be used to create and send new transactions using arbitrary public Ergo\nnodes."

It takes the entire program to run from\nstart to finish. We use the `-l` flag to print the memory usage as well.\n\n```shell\n$ /usr/bin/time -l java -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar \\\n   org.ergoplatform.appkit.examples.FreezeCoin 1000000000\n...\n       4.97 real         8.41 user         0.69 sys\n 513703936  maximum resident set size\n         0  average shared memory size\n         0  average unshared data size\n         0  average unshared stack size\n    125010  page reclaims\n      1216  page faults\n         0  swaps\n         0  block input operations\n         0  block output operations\n        13  messages sent\n        86  messages received\n         1  signals received\n      2384  voluntary context switches\n     17409  involuntary context switches\n```\n\nAs seen above, this tiny application took 2 parallel threads almost 4\nseconds to run. Most of that time can be attributed to the JVM startup and\nthe background JIT compiler running. This is quite a sub-par performance, and we know we can do a lot better.\n\nLuckily, GraalVM provides us with the perfect solution.\n\nWe can solve this inherent issue with the JVM by compiling the Java code\nahead of time into a native executable image via GraalVM. This skips over the need to use the Java just-in-time compiler\nat runtime. \n\nThe experience for us (the developer using GraalVM) is quite similar to a conventional compiler like GCC. Note,\nwe may need to run `./gradlew clean shadowJar` first.\n\n```shell\n$ ./gradlew clean shadowJar\n$ native-image --no-server \\\n -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar\\\n --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime\\\n  --no-fallback -H:+TraceClassInitialization -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces\\\n   -H:+AddAllCharsets -H:+AllowVMInspection -H:-RuntimeAssertions\\\n   --allow-incomplete-classpath \\\n    --enable-url-protocols=http,https org.ergoplatform.appkit.examples.FreezeCoin freezecoin\n[freezecoin:3133]    classlist:  35,217.78 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]        (cap):   6,063.07 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]        setup:   8,268.99 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]   (typeflow):  60,238.25 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]    (objects):  33,009.06 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]   (features):   4,796.86 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]     analysis: 102,876.01 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]     (clinit):  11,642.43 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]     universe:  13,718.96 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]      (parse):   5,053.18 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]     (inline):  18,317.24 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]    (compile):  44,806.82 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]      compile:  72,288.24 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]        image:   7,955.29 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]        write:   2,872.25 ms\n[freezecoin:3133]      [total]: 243,813.30 ms\n```\n\nThe simple command above produces a complete native executable called `freezecoin`. \n\nTo emphasize, this executable isn\u2019t a mere launcher for the JVM. In fact, it doesn\u2019t link to the JVM or bundles the JVM in any way. `native-image` compiles the FreezeCoin code, as well as any Java libraries it depends on, all the way down to simple machine code. \n\nIf we look at the libraries which `freezecoin` uses, you can see that it only uses standard system libraries. Thus, we can move just this one executable to another system that doesn't have a JVM installed, and it will run there without issue.\n\n```shell\n$ otool -L freezecoin    # ldd freezecoin on Linux\nfreezecoin:\n  /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1252.50.4)\n  /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 1455.12.0)\n  /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.11)\n```\n\nIf we time this new `freezecoin` executable, we can see that it starts approximately 8x faster and uses\naround 6x less memory. What this means is that you don\u2019t feel that palpable pause you always get when running a\nshort-running program with the JVM.\n\n```shell\n$ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GRAAL_HOME/jre/lib /usr/bin/time -l ./freezecoin 1800000000\n        0.43 real         0.15 user         0.03 sys\n  81289216  maximum resident set size\n         0  average shared memory size\n         0  average unshared data size\n         0  average unshared stack size\n     20079  page reclaims\n         0  page faults\n         0  swaps\n         0  block input operations\n         0  block output operations\n        13  messages sent\n        86  messages received\n         0  signals received\n        11  voluntary context switches\n       138  involuntary context switches\n```\n\nThis is just one of the great benefits of GraalVM, which we get to take advantage of with Appkit."

Notice the use of the `--shared` option.\n\n```shell\n$ native-image --no-server \\\n -cp build/libs/appkit-examples-3.1.0-all.jar\\\n --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime\\\n  --no-fallback -H:+TraceClassInitialization -H:+ReportExceptionStackTraces\\\n   -H:+AddAllCharsets -H:+AllowVMInspection -H:-RuntimeAssertions\\\n   --allow-incomplete-classpath \\\n    --enable-url-protocols=http,https \n    --shared -H:Name=libfreezecoin -H:Path=c-examples\n    \n$ otool -L c-examples/libfreezecoin.dylib \nc-examples/libfreezecoin.dylib:\n  .../c-examples/libfreezecoin.dylib (compatibility version 0.0.0, current version 0.0.0)\n  /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1252.50.4)\n  /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation (compatibility version 150.0.0, current version 1455.12.0)\n  /usr/lib/libz.1.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.2.11)\n```\n\nNow we can write a [C program](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit-examples/blob/master/c-examples/freezecoin.c)\nwhich uses the library.\n\nThe interface to our native library does have a bit of  boilerplate (because the VM needs to manage a heap, threads, a garbage collector\nand more), and thus we need to create an instance and provide it with our main thread.\n\n```java\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#include <libfreezecoin.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n  graal_isolate_t *isolate = NULL;\n  graal_isolatethread_t *thread = NULL;\n  \n  if (graal_create_isolate(NULL, &isolate, &thread) != 0) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"graal_create_isolate error\\n\");\n    return 1;\n  }\n\n  char * configFileName = \"freeze_coin_config.json\";\n\n  // get amountToSend from cmd args and call transaction creation\n  long amountToSend = atol(argv[1]);\n  char result[1024 * 16];\n  sendTx(thread, amountToSend, configFileName, result, sizeof(result));\n\n  // print out serialized result\n  printf(\"%s\\n\", result);\n\n  if (graal_detach_thread(thread) != 0) {\n    fprintf(stderr, \"graal_detach_thread error\\n\");\n    return 1;\n  }\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nWe can compile this with our standard system tools and easily run our executable (set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.` on Linux).\n\n```shell\n$ clang -Ic-examples -Lc-examples -lfreezecoin c-examples/freezecoin.c -o call_freezecoin\n$ otool -L call_freezecoin\n$ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GRAAL_HOME/jre/lib ./call_freezecoin 1000000000\n```"

When it breaks, we\u2019ll see values of the variables, can continue again until the next breakpoint, and do everything we've come to expect from debuggers."

      "content": "And with all of that said and done, we see just how easy it is to use Appkit to develop Ergo Applications. Appkit relies on the same core libraries which were used in implementing the Ergo consensus protocol. These libraries include the ErgoScript compiler, cryptography, byte code interpreter, data serialises and the other core components. Using GraalVM, we can reuse these tried and tested components in different application contexts without any modification or rewriting them ourselves.\n\nNo matter if you are using Java, JavaScript, Python or Ruby, you can take advantage of Appkit with GraalVM to drastically simplify the process of interacting with the Ergo blockchain while creating native-running (d)Apps."
