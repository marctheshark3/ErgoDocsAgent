  "title": "Chain Configuration Settings",
  "summary": "This document outlines the chain configuration settings for the Ergo blockchain. It covers parameters such as the protocol version, address prefix, block reward schedule, and reemission configuration. The key points are:\n\n- The protocol version should not be manually adjusted.\n- The address prefix is 0 for Ergo mainnet and 16 for Ergo testnet.\n- The block reward remains fixed for approximately 2 years, with a portion going to the foundation.\n- The block reward decreases by a fixed amount every 90 days.\n- There is a delay between when a block is mined and when the miner can spend the reward.\n- The document also mentions reemission configuration parameters, but their exact roles are not specified.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'protocolVersion' parameter?",
      "answer": "The 'protocolVersion' parameter represents the version of the blockchain protocol that the client supports."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the current value of the 'addressPrefix' parameter?",
      "answer": "The 'addressPrefix' parameter is currently set to 16, which denotes the Ergo testnet network."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long is the 'fixedRatePeriod' set to?",
      "answer": "The 'fixedRatePeriod' is set to 525,600 blocks, which is approximately two years."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'fixedRate' value set to?",
      "answer": "The 'fixedRate' is set to 75,000,000,000, which means 75 Ergo coins are issued every block during the 'fixedRatePeriod'."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should the chain-specific settings be modified?",
      "answer": "The chain-specific settings should typically be left untouched unless you are planning to launch a new blockchain."
