  "title": "Light Clients and NIPoPoWs in Ergo",
  "summary": "The document discusses the role of light clients and Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) in the Ergo blockchain ecosystem. It explains how Ergo leverages NIPoPoWs to enable efficient light clients, including pruned full nodes and Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) clients. The key advantages of NIPoPoW-based SPV clients are efficient data use, lower bandwidth consumption, and enhanced security. The document also highlights potential applications of this technology, such as mobile wallets and cross-chain transactions. The document concludes by providing further reading and resources on the technical foundations and applications of NIPoPoWs.",

This method significantly reduces the storage requirements while ensuring the node remains capable of verifying and processing transactions.\n\nA pruned full node retains critical block information and selectively prunes away data that does not contribute to future transaction validations. This is particularly useful for maintaining operational efficiency and supporting network scalability."
