While it has concise syntax adopted from Scala/Kotlin, it may still seem confusing at first because conceptually, ErgoScript is quite different from conventional languages. This is because Ergo is a UTXO-based blockchain, whereas smart contracts are traditionally associated with account-based systems like Ethereum. However, Ergo's transaction model has many advantages over the account-based model, and with the right approach, developing Ergo contracts can even be significantly easier than writing and debugging Solidity code.\n\nBelow, we cover the key aspects of the Ergo contract model that make it different:"

Ergo, on the flip side, extends UTXO to enable Turing-completeness while limiting the complexity of the ErgoScript language itself. The same expressive power is achieved in a different, more semantically sound way.\n\nWith all of the above points, it should be clear that there are many benefits to the model Ergo uses. In the rest of this article, I will introduce you to the concept of FlowCards - a dApp developer component that allows for designing complex Ergo contracts in a declarative and visual way."

      "heading": "From Imperative to Declarative",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "In the imperative programming model of Ethereum, a transaction is a sequence of operations executed by the Ethereum VM. The following [Solidity function](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#subcurrency-example) implements a transfer of tokens from `sender` to `receiver`. The transaction starts when the `sender` calls this function on an instance of a contract and ends when the function returns.\n\n```java\n// Sends an amount of existing coins from any caller to an address\nfunction send(address receiver, uint amount) public {\n    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender], \"Insufficient balance.\");\n    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;\n    balances[receiver] += amount;\n    emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount);\n}\n```\n\nThe function first checks the preconditions, then updates the storage (i.e. balances) and finally publishes the post-condition as the `Sent` event. The gas which is consumed by the transaction is sent to the miner as a reward for executing this transaction.\n\nUnlike Ethereum, a transaction in Ergo is a data structure holding a list of input coins which it spends and a list of output coins which it creates, preserving the total balances of ERGs and tokens (in which Ergo is similar to Bitcoin).\n\nTurning back to the example above, since Ergo natively supports tokens, therefore for this specific example of sending tokens, we don't need to write any code in ErgoScript. Instead, we need to create the 'send' transaction shown in the following figure, which describes the same token transfer but declaratively.\n\nThe picture visually describes the following steps, which the network user needs to\nperform:\n1) Select the sender's unspent boxes, containing a total of `tB >= amount` tokens and `B >= txFee + minErg` ERGs.\n2) Create an output `target` box protected by the `receiver` public key with `minErg` ERGs and `amount` of `T` tokens.\n3) Create one _fee_ output protected by the `minerFee` contract with `txFee` ERGs.\n4) Create one _change_ output protected by the `sender` public key, containing `B - minErg - txFee` ERGs and `tB - amount` of `T` tokens.\n5) Create a new transaction, sign it using the sender's secret key, and send it to the Ergo network.\n\nWhat is important to understand here is that all of these steps are performed _off-chain_ (for example, using the [Appkit](https://github.com/aslesarenko/ergo-appkit) Transaction API) by the user's application. Ergo network nodes don't need to repeat this transaction creation process; they only need to validate the already formed transaction. ErgoScript contracts are stored in the inputs of the transaction and check spending conditions. The node executes the contracts _on-chain_ when the transaction is validated. The transaction is valid if all conditions are satisfied.\n\nThus, in Ethereum, when we \"send amount from sender to recipient\", we are literally editing balances and updating the storage with a concrete set of commands. This happens _on-chain_, and thus a new transaction is also created _on-chain_ as the result of this process.\n\nIn Ergo (as in Bitcoin), transactions are created _off-chain_, and the network nodes only verify them. The effects of the transaction on the blockchain state are that input coins (or Boxes in Ergo's parlance) are removed, and output boxes are added to the [UTXO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unspent_transaction_output) set.\n\nIn the example above, we don't use an ErgoScript contract but instead, assume a signature check is used as the spending precondition. However, in more complex application scenarios, we, of course, need to use ErgoScript, which is what we are going to discuss next."

    {
      "heading": "From Changing State to Checking Context",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "In the `send` function example, we first checked the precondition (`require(amount <= balances[msg.sender],...)`) and then changed the state (i.e., updated balances `balances[msg.sender] -= amount`). This is typical of Ethereum transactions. Before we change anything, we need to check if it is valid to do so.\n\nIn Ergo, as we discussed previously, the state (i.e., the UTXO set of boxes) is changed implicitly when a valid transaction is included in a block. Thus, we only need to check the preconditions before the transaction can be added to the block. This is what ErgoScript contracts do.\n\nIt is not possible to \"change the state\" in ErgoScript because it is a language for checking preconditions for spending coins. ErgoScript is a purely functional language without side effects that operates on immutable data values. This means all the inputs, outputs, and other transaction parameters available in a script are immutable. This, among other things, makes ErgoScript a very simple language that is easy to learn and safe to use. Similar to Bitcoin, each input box contains a script, which should return the `true` value in order to 1) allow spending of the box (i.e., remove it from the UTXO set) and 2) allow the transaction to be added to the block.\n\nIf we are being pedantic, it is therefore incorrect (strictly speaking) to think of ErgoScript as the language of Ergo contracts because it is the language of propositions (logical predicates, formulas, etc.) that protect boxes from \"illegal\" spending. Unlike Bitcoin, in Ergo, the whole transaction and a part of the current blockchain context are available to every script. Therefore, each script may check which outputs are created by the transaction, their ERG and token amounts (we will use this capability in our example DEX contracts), the current block number, etc.\n\n*In ErgoScript, you define whether the conditions of changes (i.e., coin spending) are allowed to happen in a given context. This is in contrast to programming the changes imperatively in the code of a contract.*\n \nWhile Ergo's transaction model unlocks a whole range of applications (like DEX, DeFi Apps, LETS, etc.), designing contracts as preconditions for coin spending (or guarding scripts) directly is not intuitive. In the next sections, we will consider a useful graphical notation to design contracts declaratively using _FlowCard Diagrams_, which are a visual representation of executable components (FlowCards). \n\n_FlowCards aim to radically simplify dApp development on Ergo by providing a high-level declarative language, execution runtime, storage format, and a graphical notation_.\n\nWe will start with a high level of diagrams and go down to FlowCard specification."

In the figure, the script template is applied to the parameter `pk(sender)`, and thus a concrete wallet contract is obtained. Therefore, `pk(sender)` and `pk(receiver)` yield different scripts and represent _different_ wallets on the diagram, even though they use the same template.\n\n_Contract Wallet_ contains a set of all UTXO boxes which have a given script derived from the given script template using flow card parameters.

When the value is given as a formula, then this formula must be respected by the transaction that creates the box.\n\nIt is important to understand that variables like `amount` and `txFee` are not named properties of the boxes. They are parameters of the whole diagram and represent specific amounts. Put another way, they are shared parameters between transactions (e.g., Sell Order and Swap transactions from the DEX example below share the `tAmt` parameter). So, the same name is tied to the same value throughout the diagram (this is where tooling would help significantly). However, when it comes to _on-chain_ validation of those values, only explicit conditions marked with `?` are transformed into ErgoScript. At the same time, all other conditions are ensured _off-chain_ during transaction building (for example, in an application using the Appkit API) and during transaction validation when it is added to the blockchain."

The buyer wants to swap `ergAmt` of ERGs for `tAmt` of `TID` tokens (or vice versa, the seller wants to sell `TID` tokens for ERGs; who sends the order first doesn't matter). Both the buyer and the seller can cancel their orders at any time. The DEX off-chain matching service can find matching orders and create the `Swap` transaction to complete the exchange.\n\nThe following diagram fully (and formally) specifies all five transactions that must be created _off-chain_ by the DEX dApp. It also specifies all the spending conditions that must be verified _on-chain_.\n\nLet's discuss the FlowCard diagram and the logic of each transaction in detail:"

The `buyOrder` script is synthesized from the specification (see below at **\"From Diagrams To ErgoScript Contracts\"**) either manually or automatically by a tool. Even though we don't need to define the `buyOrder` script explicitly during design, at run time, the `bid` box must contain the `buyOrder` script as the guarding proposition (which checks the box spending conditions); otherwise, the conditions specified in the diagram will not be checked.\n\nThe `change` box is created to make the input and output sums of the transaction balanced. The transaction fee box is omitted because it can be added automatically by the tools. In practice, however, the designer can add the fee box explicitly to the diagram.

When a box has spending alternatives (or _spending paths_), each alternative is identified by a unique name prefixed with `!` (`!cancel` and `!swap` for the `bid` box). Each alternative path has specific spending conditions. In our example, when the `Cancel Buy` transaction spends the `bid` box, the `?buyer` condition must be satisfied, which we read as \"the signature for the `buyer` address must be presented in the transaction\".

The transaction has several spending conditions on the input boxes, and those conditions are included in the `buyOrder` and `sellOrder` scripts, which are verified when the transaction is added to the blockchain. However, on the diagram, those conditions are not specified in the `bid` and `ask` boxes; they are instead defined in the output boxes of the transaction.\n\nThis is a convention for improved usability because most conditions relate to the properties of the output boxes. We could specify those properties in the `bid` box, but then we would have to use more complex expressions. \n\nLet's consider the output created by the arrow labeled with `buyerOut@0`. This label tells us that the output is at index `0` in the `OUTPUTS` collection of the transaction and that in the diagram, we can refer to this box by the `buyerOut` name. Thus, we can label both the box itself and the arrow to give the box a name.\n\nThe conditions shown in the `buyerOut` box have the form `bid ? condition`, which means they must be verified _on-chain_ in order to spend the `bid` box. The conditions have the following meaning:  \n\n- `tAmt: TID` requires the box to have `tAmt` amount of `TID` token.\n- `R4 == bid.id` requires the R4 register in the box to be equal to the id of the `bid` box.\n- `script == buyer` requires the `buyerOut` box to have the script of the wallet where it is located on the diagram (i.e., `pk(buyer)`).\n\nSimilar properties are added to the `sellerOut` box, which is specified to be at index `1`, and the name is given to it using the label on the box itself rather than on the arrow.\n\nThe `Swap` transaction spends two boxes, `bid` and `ask`, using the `!swap` spending path on both; however, unlike `!cancel`, the conditions on the path are not specified. This is where the `bid ?` and `ask ?` prefixes come into play. They are used so that the conditions listed in the `buyerOut` and `sellerOut` boxes are moved to the `!swap` spending path of the `bid` and `ask` boxes, respectively. \n\nIf you look at the conditions of the output boxes, you will see that they exactly specify the swap of values between the seller's and buyer's wallets. The buyer gets the necessary amount of the `TID` token, and the seller gets the corresponding amount of ERGs. The `Swap` transaction is created when there are two matching boxes with `buyOrder` and `sellOrder` contracts."

      "content": "What is interesting about FlowCard specifications is that we can use them to automatically generate the necessary [ErgoTree](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoTree.pdf) scripts. With appropriate tooling support, this can be done automatically, but lacking that, it can be done manually. Thus, the FlowCard allows us to capture and visually represent all design choices and semantic details of an Ergo dApp. \n\nWhat we are going to do next is mechanically create the `buyOrder` contract from the information given in the `DEX` flow card. Recall that each script is a proposition (boolean-valued expression) that must evaluate to `true` to allow spending of the box. When we have many conditions to be met simultaneously, we can combine them in a logical formula using the AND binary operation, and if we have alternatives (not necessarily exclusive), we can put them into the OR operation. The `buyOrder` box has the alternative spending paths `!cancel` and `!swap`. \n\nThus, the ErgoScript code should have an OR operation with two arguments - one for each spending path.\n\n```java\n/** buyOrder contract */\n{\n  val cancelCondition = {}\n  val swapCondition = {}\n  cancelCondition || swapCondition\n}\n```\nThe formula for the `cancelCondition` expression is given in the `!cancel` spending path\nof the `buyOrder` box. We can directly include it in the script.\n\n```java\n/** buyOrder contract */\n{\n  val cancelCondition = { buyer }\n  val swapCondition = {}\n  cancelCondition || swapCondition\n}\n```\n\nFor the `!swap` spending path of the `buyOrder` box, the conditions are specified in the\n`buyerOut` output box of the `Swap` transaction. If we simply include them in the\n`swapCondition`, then we get a syntactically incorrect script.\n\n```java\n/** buyOrder contract */\n{\n  val cancelCondition = { buyer }\n  val swapCondition = {\n    tAmt: TID &&\n    R4 == bid.id &&\n    @contract\n  }\n  cancelCondition || swapCondition\n}\n```\nWe can, however, translate the conditions from the diagram syntax to ErgoScript expressions using the following simple rules:\n1) `buyerOut@0` ==> `val buyerOut = OUTPUTS(0)`\n2) `tAmt: TID`  ==> `tid._2 == tAmt` where `tid = buyerOut.tokens(TID)`\n3) `R4 == bid.id`  ==> `R4 == SELF.id` where `R4 = buyerOut.R4[Coll[Byte]].get`\n4) `script == buyer`  ==> `buyerOut.propositionBytes == buyer.propBytes` \n\nNote, in the diagram, `TID` represents a token ID, but ErgoScript doesn't have access to tokens by their IDs, so we cannot write `tokens.getByKey(TID)`. For this reason, when the diagram is translated into ErgoScript, `TID` becomes a named constant representing the index in the `tokens` collection of the box. The concrete value of the constant is assigned when the `BuyOrder` transaction with the `buyOrder` box is created. The correspondence and consistency between the actual token ID, the `TID` constant, and the actual tokens of the `buyerOut` box is ensured by the _off-chain_ application code; this is completely possible since all transactions are created by the application using the FlowCard as a guiding specification. This may sound complicated, but it is part of the translation from diagram specification to actual executable application code, most of which can be automated.\n\nAfter the transformation, we can obtain a correct script that checks all the required preconditions for spending the `buyOrder` box.\n```java\n/** buyOrder contract */\ndef DEX(buyer: Addrss, seller: Address, TID: Int, ergAmt: Long, tAmt: Long)\n{\n  val cancelCondition: SigmaProp = { buyer }      // verify buyer's sig (ProveDlog)\n  val swapCondition = OUTPUTS.size > 0 && {       // securing OUTPUTS access\n    val buyerOut = OUTPUTS(0)                     // from buyerOut@0\n    buyerOut.tokens.size > TID && {               // securing tokens access\n      val tid = buyerOut.tokens(TID)\n      val regR4 = buyerOut.R4[Coll[Byte]]\n      regR4.isDefined && {                        // securing R4 access\n        val R4 = regR4.get\n        tid._2 == tAmt &&                             // from tAmt: TID \n        R4 == SELF.id &&                              // from R4 == bid.id\n        buyerOut.propositionBytes == buyer.propBytes  // from script == buyer\n      }\n    } \n  }\n  cancelCondition || swapCondition\n}\n```\nA similar script for the `sellOrder` box can be obtained using the same translation rules.\nWith the help of the tooling, the code of contracts can be mechanically generated from the\ndiagram specification."

      "content": "Declarative programming models have already won the battle against imperative programming in many application domains (like Big Data, Stream Processing, Deep Learning, Databases, etc.). Ergo is pioneering the declarative model of dApp development as a better and safer alternative to the now-popular imperative model of smart contracts.\n\nThe concept of FlowCard shifts the focus from writing ErgoScript contracts to the overall flow of values (hence the name) in such a way that ErgoScript can always be generated from them. You may never need to look at the ErgoScript code once the tooling is in place.\n\nHere are the possible next steps for future work:\n\n1) Storage format for FlowCard Spec and a corresponding EIP-standardized file format (JSON/XML/Protobuf). This will allow various tools (Diagram Editor, Runtime, dApps, etc.) to create and use `*.flowcard` files.\n\n2) FlowCard Viewer, which can generate diagrams from `*.flowcard` files.\n\n3) FlowCard Runtime, which can run `*.flowcard` files, create, and send transactions to the Ergo network.\n\n4) FlowCard Designer Tool, which can simplify the development of complex diagrams. This will make designing and validating Ergo contracts a pleasant experience, more like drawing than coding. In addition, the correctness of the whole dApp scenario can be verified and controlled by the tooling."
