  "title": "Boxes and Registers",
  "summary": "The document introduces the concept of 'boxes' and 'registers' in the Ergo blockchain. Boxes are similar to UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) in other cryptocurrencies, but they can also contain additional data in the form of 'registers'. This makes Ergo's boxes more flexible and functional than traditional UTXOs, enabling more complex operations such as running scripts or smart contracts directly on the blockchain. The document also highlights the differences between Ergo's boxes and the UTXOs used in other UTXO-based cryptocurrencies.",

    {
      "question": "What is a 'box' in the context of ErgoScript?",
      "answer": "In ErgoScript, a 'box' is a more versatile version of a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output), representing a ledger entry that contains not only the amount of cryptocurrency owned by a particular address, but also additional data stored in 'registers'."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do 'registers' in Ergo's boxes differ from traditional UTXOs?",
      "answer": "Ergo's boxes can contain additional data in their 'registers', beyond just the unspent cryptocurrency amount, which can be integrated into transactions and used in the execution of smart contracts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between Ergo's boxes and UTXOs in other cryptocurrencies?",
      "answer": "In UTXO-based cryptocurrencies, each transaction consumes one or more UTXOs as inputs and creates one or more UTXOs as outputs, with the 'unspent' outputs being the 'coins' that can be spent in future transactions. Ergo's boxes, on the other hand, can hold additional data beyond just the unspent cryptocurrency amount."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'box' concept in Ergo?",
      "answer": "The 'box' concept in Ergo captures the idea that these entities are like containers holding various types of information (value, tokens, custom data, etc.), beyond just the unspent transaction output."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can one find examples of using the register data in Ergo's boxes?",
      "answer": "Interpreting the register data in Ergo's boxes off-chain is a common task, and examples of using this data can be found in the Fleet SDK Recipes, which provide examples using JavaScript/TypeScript."

      "content": "In [ErgoScript](ergoscript.md), a ['box'](box.md) is akin to a more versatile version of what a [UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)](eutxo.md) represents in Bitcoin and many other [cryptocurrencies](protocol-overview.md). A box is not only a ledger entry denoting the amount of cryptocurrency owned by a particular [address](address.md), but it also carries ['registers'](registers.md), allowing it to contain additional data. This data could range from simple values to more complex structures, which can later be integrated into [transactions](transactions.md) and used in the execution of [smart contracts](contracts.md). Interpreting this register data off-chain is a common task; see [Fleet SDK Recipes](fleet-sdk-recipes.md) for examples using JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\nThis makes Ergo's box different from a traditional UTXO, which only represents an amount of unspent cryptocurrency associated with a certain address. In [UTXO-based cryptocurrencies](eutxo.md), each [transaction](transactions.md) consumes one or more [UTXOs](eutxo.md) as [inputs](transactions.md) and creates one or more [UTXOs](eutxo.md) as [outputs](transactions.md), with the 'unspent' outputs being the 'coins' that can be spent in future [transactions](transactions.md).\n\nThe term ['box'](box.md) in Ergo's context captures the idea that these entities are like containers holding various types of information (value, [tokens](eip4.md), custom data, etc.), beyond just the [unspent transaction output balance](eutxo.md). This makes the boxes in Ergo significantly more flexible and functional, enabling more complex operations, such as running [scripts](ergoscript.md) or [smart contracts](contracts.md), directly on the [blockchain](protocol-overview.md)."
