  "summary": "In the UTXO model, a singleton token is a token issued with a quantity of exactly one unit. Singleton tokens can be used to emulate long-lived accounts, where a transaction that spends an old box with the singleton token and creates a new one can be controlled by the script of the old box, allowing a smart account marked with the token to exist and alter its state. One specific example of a singleton token is an oracle, such as a token created to act as an ERG/EUR exchange rates oracle, where the box containing the token encodes the exchange rate in a specific register, and contracts can refer to the oracle token identifier beforehand.",

      "answer": "In the UTXO model, a token issued with a quantity of exactly one unit is referred to as a `singleton` token."

    {
      "question": "How can singleton tokens be used to emulate long-lived accounts?",
      "answer": "A transaction that spends an old box with the singleton token and creates a new one can be controlled by the script of the old box, requiring the new box to have certain characteristics (such as a specific script or amount). This allows a smart account, marked with the token, to exist and alter its state as dictated by the smart account contract through a chain of transactions."

      "question": "What is an example of a singular token?",
      "answer": "One specific example of a singular token is an [oracle](oracles.md). For instance, a token can be created to act as an ERG/EUR exchange rates oracle."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can contracts interact with a singleton token acting as an oracle?",
      "answer": "Since the oracle is a long-lived account, contracts can know the oracle token identifier beforehand and refer to it."

This allows a smart account, marked with the token, to exist and alter its state as dictated by the smart account contract through a chain of transactions."

Singleton tokens can be used to emulate long-lived accounts similar to those found in Waves, Ethereum Classic, etc. A transaction that spends an old box with the singleton token and creates a new one can be controlled by the script of the old box, requiring the new box to have certain characteristics (such as a specific script or amount). This allows a smart account, marked with the token, to exist and alter its state as dictated by the smart account contract through a chain of transactions.\n\nOne specific example of a singular token is an [oracle](oracles.md). For instance, a token can be created to act as an ERG/EUR exchange rates oracle. A box that contains this token would encode the exchange rate in a specific register.
