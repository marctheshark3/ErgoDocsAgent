  "title": "Why Ergo?",
  "summary": "Ergo is a next-generation smart contract platform that aims to ensure the economic freedom of ordinary people through secure, accessible, and decentralized financial tools. It is backed by a powerful scripting language, advanced cryptographic features, and a foundation rooted in the best principles of blockchain technology. Ergo is a fusion of research and practicality, merging proven concepts with the latest in peer-reviewed academic research. It offers a reliable foundation for dApps to operate with predictable costs, with smart contracts ensuring Turing completeness without compromising on predictability or affordability. Ergo leverages Sigma Protocols to power its smart contracts, enabling the use of efficient zero-knowledge proofs and fostering a trustless environment with unparalleled application-level privacy. Ergo's dedication to universal blockchain security is evident through its implementation of Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work, making it accessible on virtually any device. Ergo transcends the traditional concept of a blockchain token, embodying commodity money with real-world consumption of resources for mining, and supporting decentralized derivatives and DeFi without intermediaries. Ergo was launched in 2019 with a fair and equitable start, reflecting Bitcoin's foundational principles to prevent undue influence from large-scale investors, and has a fixed supply of 97,739,924 coins with an extended emission schedule.",
