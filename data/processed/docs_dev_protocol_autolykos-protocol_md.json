  "summary": "The document provides an introduction to Autolykos, the Proof of Work algorithm used for Ergo mining. It describes Autolykos as a fairly launched, efficient, and ASIC-resistant algorithm. The document also includes links to related topics such as mining setup, the Autolykos algorithm, governance, storage rent, difficulty adjustment, and the Ergo emission schedule.",

      "question": "What is Autolykos?",
      "answer": "Autolykos is a fairly launched efficient ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm used for Ergo mining."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key features of the Autolykos algorithm?",
      "answer": "Autolykos is ASIC-resistant and uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Ergo mining process work?",
      "answer": "Ergo mining is based on the Autolykos algorithm, which is a Proof of Work consensus mechanism."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Ergo Storage Rent feature?",
      "answer": "The Ergo Storage Rent feature reduces the problem of blockchain bloat through on-chain garbage collection."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the mining difficulty adjusted on the Ergo blockchain?",
      "answer": "The mining difficulty on the Ergo blockchain is adjusted to maintain a consistent block time."
