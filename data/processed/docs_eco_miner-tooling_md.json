  "title": "Miner Tooling",
  "summary": "The document provides an overview of various miner tooling projects in the Ergo ecosystem. It covers decentralized applications like GuapSwap, Lithos, and CYTI, which aim to improve the mining experience and promote decentralization. The document also discusses innovations in mining, such as Log-Space Mining and SmartPools, which aim to make mining more efficient and decentralized. Additionally, it introduces the concept of Subpooling, a strategy that allows small-time miners to pool their hash rates and increase their chances of earning rewards.",

      "question": "What is GuapSwap?",
      "answer": "GuapSwap allows miners to swap mined erg for native tokens."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the goal of the Lithos project?",
      "answer": "Lithos aims to create a decentralized mining pool infrastructure that provides a low-risk opportunity for lenders to earn yield on their ERG by providing collateral to mining pools while promoting increasingly decentralized block production."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the benefits of Lithos for miners?",
      "answer": "Lithos enables miners to directly insert necessary transactions into blocks in a fully decentralized and trustless manner, bringing significant benefits to miners outside of just decentralization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What has Lithos recently accomplished?",
      "answer": "Lithos has recently completed collateral contracts, and the ability of miners to directly insert necessary transactions into blocks has been successfully demonstrated during the ERGOHACK VI event."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key ecosystem projects focused on building miner tooling?",
      "answer": "The key ecosystem projects focused on building miner tooling are GuapSwap and Lithos."

It allows an entity to mint tokens with a given character sequence at the beginning of the token ID. A token minter creates a CYTI request, and miners generate the proper token ID using the CYTI miner software. When one of the miners succeeds, they receive the fee from the CYTI contract and the token with the right token ID is sent to the token minter."

It allows smart contracts to retain historical data, enabling new light miners to operate in an online mode. This concept, known as Logarithmic Space Mining, allows for the compilation of unnecessary parts of the blockchain data into the blockchain itself. New miners don't need to carry historical data, and as they continue to mine, they assist other light miners in bootstrapping. This eliminates the need to carry old historical data, allowing old miners to discard historical data for lighter mining."

It is a smart contract-based mining pool that allows groups of friends to pool together their hash rates in order to get mining pool rewards quicker than they would alone. Subpooling allows members to mine to the same address without worrying about one person controlling the funds. The goal of this dApp is to help encourage the decentralisation of mining pools while also promoting small-time miners who may not be able to get block rewards fast enough on normal mining pools."
