  "title": "SmartPools: A Decentralized Mining Solution",
  "summary": "SmartPools are a decentralized alternative to traditional mining pools, replacing centralized mining pools with autonomous on-chain smart contracts. The concept of SmartPools was first introduced at the ErgoHacks event, and the Lithos Protocol represents the next generation of SmartPools. SmartPools aim to address issues associated with centralized mining pools, such as high fees, lack of transparency, and the threat to network security. The SmartPools mining model offers advantages like verifiable and fair mining pool contracts and reward schemes, on-chain deduction of fees, and prevention of hash-power manipulation. Ergo believes that SmartPools represent a necessary step towards future decentralization in blockchain technology.",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "The concept of SmartPools was first introduced at the ErgoHacks event. The idea was to replace centralized mining pools with an autonomous on-chain smart contract. A team of developers spent a weekend researching this concept and produced a whitepaper outlining their findings. This work was continued by another developer at ErgoHack II, who implemented the 'Sub Pooling' design specified in the SmartPools whitepaper."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "In traditional mining pools, fees can vary between 1-3%, and miners can never be sure if they are getting their fair share. SmartPools aim to create transparency in this area, ensuring that miners' shares are distributed as earned. While the fees for using SmartPools may initially be around 1%, it is expected that these will be reduced to approximately 0.1% in the future to cover upkeep costs."

      "content": "The SmartPools mining model offers several advantages:\n\n    - Mining pool contracts and reward schemes are verifiable and fair.\n    - Fees needed to maintain the server and fund the developers can be deducted on-chain.\n    - Decentralized mining models can prevent the manipulation of hash-power.\n\nErgo believes that SmartPools represent a necessary and essential step towards future decentralization. As we build the blockchain of the future, we hope to see as many facets of decentralization as possible."
