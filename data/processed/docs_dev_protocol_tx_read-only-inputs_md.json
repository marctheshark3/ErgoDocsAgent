  "summary": "Data Inputs in ErgoScript are a novel feature that enhances the traditional UTXO-based blockchain's functionality. Data inputs allow transactions to reference and read from existing UTXOs without consuming them, overcoming limitations of the classic UTXO model. Key features include non-destructive access and concurrent data access. Benefits include reduced transaction fees, enhanced DeFi applications, and improved scalability and efficiency. Data inputs are used in ErgoScript transactions to access information without modifying the referenced boxes. This represents a significant advancement over traditional UTXO models, facilitating more complex and interactive smart contracts. Best practices include selective use of data inputs, ensuring reliable data sources, and performing validation checks.",

      "content": "Traditional UTXO-based blockchains involve the consumption and subsequent destruction of inputs during transactions. Ergo innovates on this model with **data inputs**, which permit transactions to reference and read from existing UTXOs without the need to consume them. This breakthrough overcomes several limitations of the classic UTXO model, adding a layer of flexibility and efficiency to Ergo's extended UTXO (eUTXO) model."

      "content": "- **Non-Destructive Access:** Data inputs grant transactions the ability to tap into UTXO contents without the need to spend or consume them, preserving the UTXOs for future transactions.\n- **Concurrent Data Access:** Data inputs allow for the simultaneous referencing and reading of a UTXO's data by multiple transactions within a single block, without any of them spending the UTXO. This feature facilitates parallel processing and alleviates transaction execution bottlenecks."

      "heading": "Benefits of Data Inputs",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The integration of data inputs into ErgoScript offers several notable benefits:\n\n1. **Reduced Transaction Fees:** Since data inputs do not necessitate script execution or the generation of new outputs, they contribute to lower transaction fees, making them an economical choice for intricate transactions.\n  \n2. **Enhanced DeFi Applications:** Data inputs prove invaluable for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or order-book systems. They enable contracts to reference external data, like oracle data or order book states, without the need to consume the data boxes, facilitating concurrent interactions with the same state by multiple parties.\n\n3. **Improved Scalability and Efficiency:** Data inputs contribute to network scalability and efficiency by allowing several transactions to concurrently read from the same data input, reducing the necessity for extra outputs and lessening the likelihood of transaction conflicts."

      "heading": "Usage in Transactions",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "In ErgoScript, data inputs are \"read-only\" boxes that supply vital information for contract validation without being spent in the transaction. For instance, a DeFi contract might utilize a data input to verify an asset's current price from an oracle box, ensuring the transaction complies with specific conditions without modifying the oracle box."

    {
      "heading": "Example Use Case",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Imagine a transaction that references a box with the ID `d2b9b6536287b242f436436ce5a1e4a117d7b4843a13ce3abe3168bff99924a1` as both an input and a data input. This illustrates the versatility of data inputs, enabling a transaction to read and potentially update a box's state in one operation, assuming the box pre-existed the transaction.\n\nIn ErgoScript, you can refer to other boxes in the transaction using constructs like:\n\n```scala\nINPUTS(0).value > 10000 && OUTPUTS(1).value > 20000\n```\n\nThis script enforces conditions based on the values of the first input and the second output boxes, showcasing how data inputs can be used to influence the logic of a transaction without consuming the referenced boxes."
