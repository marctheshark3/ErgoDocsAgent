  "summary": "This document compares the extended UTXO (eUTXO) models of the Ergo and Cardano blockchain platforms. Ergo was founded by Alex Chepurnoy and Dmitry Meshakov, who previously worked on Cardano. Ergo uses the ErgoScript language, while Cardano uses Plutus, both of which are strongly typed and support advanced features. \n\nThe document discusses the differences in token minting policies between the two platforms. Ergo's token issuance is standardized through EIP4, with tokens stored in the R2 register of a box. Cardano's native tokens are identified by a policy ID and asset name, with a minimum ADA value required to transfer them.\n\nThe document also compares the global state management approaches of Ergo and Cardano. Ergo utilizes transaction trees to achieve Turing completeness, while Cardano's state management is influenced by its Plutus language and transaction validation process.",

      "content": "Ergo employs a language known as [ErgoScript](ergoscript.md), which draws inspiration from [Scala](scala.md). Conversely, Cardano uses a language named Plutus, which is inspired by Haskell. Ergo stores data in [registers](registers.md), while Cardano uses *\"datum\"* for data storage. Despite these differences, both platforms allocate a space within the UTXO to maintain the state of decentralised applications (dApps). Cardano employs a two-layer architecture, utilizing Plutus for smart contracts and Marlowe for financial contracts.\n\nErgoScript, the scripting language of Ergo, facilitates the development of complex smart contracts and advanced features. Cardano's Plutus language is also robust and powerful, but in some cases, certain complex functionalities may necessitate the incorporation of supplementary components or alternative approaches to implementation.\n\nHere's a comparison of ErgoScript and Plutus (Cardano's smart contract language):\n\n| Feature                         | ErgoScript (Ergo)                                   | Plutus (Cardano)                  |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Language design                 | Based on Scorex framework, influenced by Scala      | Based on Haskell                  |\n| Strongly typed                  | Yes                                                 | Yes                               |\n| First-class functions           | Yes                                                 | Yes                               |\n| Higher-order functions          | Yes                                                 | Yes                               |\n| Rich data structures            | Registers, boxes                                    | Datum, UTXO                       |\n| Zero-knowledge proofs           | Supported                                           | Planned for future development    |\n| Complex authentication schemes  | Supported                                           | Supported                         |\n| Transaction Trees               | Supported                                           | Not Supported                     |\n\nBoth Ergo and Cardano's models support non-fungible assets and complex types of representation on the blockchain.\n\nAfter compilation, both ErgoScript and Plutus contracts output a JSON representation. For Ergo, this JSON could include the ErgoTree, compile-time constants, and compiler version. Having a standardized JSON output allows transactions to interact with the compiled contracts seamlessly.\n\nFor a tangible example, please refer to this [ErgoScript contract](https://gist.github.com/mgpai22/638dcd9efdec5f74113a476175c7ee74) that has been ported to the [Winter Cardano Contracts](https://github.com/zenGate-Global/winter-cardano-contracts) framework.\n\nIn this example, the original ErgoScript contract has been adapted to work with the Cardano Contracts framework. The ported contract demonstrates how the logic and functionality of an ErgoScript contract can be translated to the Cardano ecosystem using the Winter framework. This allows developers to leverage their existing knowledge of ErgoScript and apply it to building smart contracts on Cardano."

      "heading": "Native Tokens on Cardano",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Native tokens on Cardano allow for the transacting of multiple assets, including ada and custom tokens, without the need for smart contracts. This feature extends the accounting infrastructure to accommodate various assets. Native tokens are different from non-native tokens that require smart contracts.\n\nAssets on Cardano are uniquely identified by an asset ID, consisting of a policy ID and asset name. Tokens with the same asset ID are fungible. Ada is the principal currency for fees and rewards, while native tokens can be used for payments and transactions.\n\nCardano's minting policy uniquely identifies each native asset with a permanent policy ID, which originates from the policy script. The policy script further defines other attributes, such as the asset's name and amount/value. Since asset names are not unique, Cardano NFTs must be identified by the policy ID, which can be publicly available to distinguish fraudulent/duplicate NFTs from the original tokens.\n\nA minimum ada value is required to transfer native tokens between addresses. Token bundles organize tokens and are the standard way to represent assets on Cardano.\n\nMinting policies specify the rules for creating and burning tokens, and each asset has a permanent association with a minting policy. The native token lifecycle involves minting, issuing, using, redeeming, and burning tokens, with various actors involved, such as asset controllers, token issuers, and token holders. Tokens can also be reissued by token holders acting as reissuers for trading or liquidity purposes."

      "heading": "Global State Management",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The management of global state in Ergo and Cardano is influenced by their respective scripting languages and transaction validation processes. Ergo utilizes ErgoScript, a call-by-value, higher-order functional language without recursion. ErgoScript defines a guarding proposition for a coin as a logical formula that combines predicates over a context and cryptographic statements provable via \u03a3-protocols with AND, OR, k-out-of-n connectives. \n\nAlthough ErgoScript is not inherently Turing complete, Turing completeness can be achieved in Ergo using transaction trees, as outlined in this [peer reviewed paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10116v1.pdf). A transaction tree is a structure where transactions are organized into a tree, with each transaction referencing its parent transaction(s). This allows for complex, multi-step computations to be executed across multiple transactions, effectively making Ergo Turing complete.\n\nThis organization of transactions enables developers to create more complex and flexible smart contracts on Ergo, similar to those written in Cardano's Plutus language. However, this method requires more manual construction of transaction structures and may not be as intuitive as using a Turing-complete language like Plutus.\n\nErgo's transaction validation uses the *ErgoLikeStateContext* trait and [ErgoLikeStateContext](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/sdk/shared/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/sdk/wallet/protocol/context/ErgoLikeStateContext.scala) case class to represent the blockchain context. The sigmaLastHeaders method provides information about the previous blocks, while the previousStateDigest method provides the UTXO set digest from the last header. The sigmaPreHeader method provides information about the current block being validated.\n\nIn contrast, Cardano uses Plutus, a Turing-complete, higher-order functional programming language subset of Haskell, designed specifically for smart contracts. While ErgoScript focuses on the transactional model and guarding propositions for coins, Plutus provides a more general-purpose language for writing smart contracts.\n\nFor more information, refer to these foundational papers:\n\n- [Improving authenticated dynamic dictionaries, with applications to cryptocurrencies](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/994.pdf)\n- [Self-reproducing Coins as Universal Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.10116)\n- [Multi-stage Contracts in the UTXO Model](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/paper_26.pdf)\n- [EDRAX: A Cryptocurrency with Stateless Transaction Validation](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/968.pdf)"

      "content": "Ergo's cryptographic design incorporates [Sigma protocols](sigma.md), providing extensive access to discrete log-based zero-knowledge proofs, offering potential advantages in privacy and security. Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic techniques that enable a prover to demonstrate the truth of a statement to a verifier without revealing any additional information. In the context of blockchain technology, zero-knowledge proofs can enhance privacy and security by allowing transactions and smart contracts to be executed without disclosing sensitive data.\n\nDiscrete log-based zero-knowledge proofs refer to a class of zero-knowledge proofs that rely on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem, a foundational concept in modern cryptography. ErgoScript, the scripting language used in Ergo, provides access to \u03a3-protocols, a subclass of cryptographic proof systems known as non-interactive \u03a3-protocols. These \u03a3-protocols include the Schnorr signature scheme and Diffie-Hellman tuple, which can be used to prove knowledge of discrete logarithms. This efficient and flexible implementation of zero-knowledge proofs can improve privacy-enhancing features and applications on Ergo.\n\nErgo's Sigma Protocols enable the implementation of sophisticated tasks that would otherwise be impossible, risky, or expensive, allowing for self-sovereign application-level privacy. Trustless scripts can access mixers or other functionality without any third parties required. Using Ergo for such applications, users can achieve enhanced privacy and security compared to other platforms."

However, having to spend every single UTXO which you wish to read data from has several drawbacks:\n\n- The smart contract of the UTXO with the data must execute, thereby increasing computation complexity/cost.\n- The UTXO must be spent, meaning only one transaction can use the UTXO data per block/slot.\n- Transaction fees increase due to needless excess execution & recreation of the output data UTXO.\n- Every UTXO which wishes to allow read access through spending must encode the logic directly within their smart contract.\n- It is liable to spam attacks by bad actors who wish to wreak havoc on a protocol.\n- Increased off-chain complexity in transaction creation & finding the latest UTXO.\n\nTo address these issues, the core Ergo developers, Alexander Slesarenko, Alex Chepurnoy, and Dmitry Meshkov, introduced the concept of \"*read-only inputs*\". These allow any transaction to reference any other box(UTXO) currently in the UTXO set and read the data without any problems listed in the previous section."

This bridge enables the transfer of wrapped ADA tokens from Cardano to Ergo and vice versa, promoting interoperability and collaboration between the platforms and their communities. Cardano users can now access the DeFi ecosystem on Ergo with this bridge using wrapped ADA or native ADA tokens.\n\nMoreover, ErgoMixer, as the only token mixer in the space, enables users to mix wrapped ADA and other native tokens, such as wrapped HOSKY.
