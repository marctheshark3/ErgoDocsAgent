  "summary": "The document discusses the compatibility of flash loans with Ergo's eUTXO (Extended Unspent Transaction Output) blockchain model. It highlights the multifaceted utility of flash loans, the unique challenges posed by the deterministic UTXO model, and potential solutions such as multi-stage contracts, data inputs, and atomicity through soft or hard forks. The document also touches on the ethical and security implications of flash loans, particularly their role in exploiting vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols.",

In eUTXO blockchains, each of these steps would be its own transaction, requiring pre-calculation due to the deterministic nature of the model. However, [Multi-stage contracts](multi.md) offer a workaround by holding interim states and facilitating parallel actions, thereby emulating complex, multi-step processes."

In eUTXO systems, this would mean bundling various UTXOs into a single transaction, a task that is complex but not necessarily prohibitive. Ergo's [data inputs](read-only-inputs.md) feature allows transactions to reference existing UTXOs without consuming them. This feature could serve as a potential solution by providing a mechanism to reference multiple protocols within a single transaction. It allows for the creation of complex, interdependent transactions without the need for consuming the UTXOs involved. This could potentially pave the way for more dynamic and flexible transactions, akin to those seen in account-based systems, while still maintaining the security and predictability inherent in the UTXO model."

This is straightforward in account-based blockchains where multiple interactions can occur within the same block. eUTXO blockchains do not offer such guarantees, making it risky if a multi-step flash loan transaction spans across multiple blocks. However, Ergo developers have discussed the possibility of introducing atomicity through a soft fork, using a special ID context variable to enforce a chain of transactions. Alternatively, a hard fork could also be considered to introduce atomicity, although this would be a more significant change requiring community consensus.\n\n> **Community Insight**: A soft fork could be a less disruptive way to introduce atomicity, although it would add another layer of complexity. The hard fork option, while more significant, would also be a definitive way to address the issue."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "1. **Isolation Factor**: Traditional financial attacks usually require the attacker to commit their own capital, exposing them to market risks. Flash loans, however, allow attackers to operate in isolation, bypassing the natural countermeasures in market-based security mechanisms.\n\n2. **Absence of Market Counterbalance**: Financial markets usually self-correct, where for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction. For example, a large purchase order is often offset by a large sale. Flash loans upset this natural equilibrium by enabling outsized actions without immediate counterbalance.\n\n3. **Lowered Barriers to Entry**: While highly motivated and capitalized actors can exploit financial systems, flash loans make it easier for a wider array of attackers to engage in malicious activities, thus expanding the attack surface.\n\n4. **Time-Sensitivity**: Flash loans must be borrowed and repaid within a single transaction block, minimizing the time for countermeasures or market corrections to take effect.\n\n5. **Vulnerability of On-Chain Oracles**: Protocols relying on on-chain oracles for real-time price information are especially susceptible. Flash loans can rapidly distort market conditions within a single transaction block, effectively manipulating the oracles upon which these protocols depend."

      "content": "To better understand the security implications, consider the case outlined in the aforementioned research paper:\n\nIn this transaction, an attacker uses a flash loan to borrow 7,500 ETH. They then proceed to convert portions of this amount into sUSD through a series of trades, strategically lowering the sUSD/ETH price as reported by Uniswap and Kyber Reserve\u2014two Automated Market Makers (AMMs) serving as on-chain oracles. The attacker exploits this manipulated price to collateralize an excessive amount of sUSD, ultimately repaying the flash loan and walking away with a substantial profit.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, rapid price changes on Uniswap and Kyber would trigger arbitrage bots to correct the market imbalance. This natural market reaction would make such an attack infeasible. However, the time-sensitive nature of flash loans circumvents this safeguard."

Proponents argue that the technology itself is a neutral tool and its ethical implications depend on its application. Nonetheless, the community is divided on whether the benefits of flash loans outweigh the serious ethical and security concerns they present."
