  "title": "Input Blocks and Ordering Blocks \u2013 Technical Details**",
  "summary": "The document discusses the technical details of Ergo's Input Blocks and Ordering Blocks, which are introduced to address limitations in the current blockchain system. The key points are:\n\n- Transactions currently enter a common mempool and are included in blocks produced every 2 minutes. Replace-By-Fee (RBF) can lead to issues like fee competitions.\n- Ergo introduces Input Blocks and Ordering Blocks to enable faster transaction propagation while preserving overall network security.\n- Input Blocks have a lower difficulty threshold and are produced more frequently, while Ordering Blocks maintain the original PoW requirements.\n- Transactions are classified as First-Class (consistent validation) or Second-Class (dependent on block variables).\n- Merkle trees and digest fields are used to ensure consistency and efficient verification of transaction data across Input and Ordering Blocks.\n- Efficient propagation mechanisms, including announcement, data verification, and cut-through techniques, are employed to rapidly disseminate transaction identifiers and confirmations.",

      "question": "What is the current process for transactions entering the Ergo blockchain?",
      "answer": "Transactions from wallets enter a common mempool, and miners include these transactions in blocks produced roughly every 2 minutes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and how can it lead to issues?",
      "answer": "RBF allows users to increase transaction fees for faster inclusion or even cancel a transaction by refunding the sender's wallet, which can sometimes lead to issues, such as with SigmaUSD mint transactions during fee competitions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the limitations of the current Ergo block production system?",
      "answer": "The current system has variable confirmation times, with some transactions taking as long as 10 minutes to confirm, and involves repeated manual steps that slow down the overall process."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two new types of blocks being introduced in Ergo?",
      "answer": "Ergo is introducing two kinds of blocks via a non-breaking consensus protocol update, following ideas in PRISM, Parallel Proof-of-Work, and Tailstorm."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the current Ergo block validity defined?",
      "answer": "A valid block in the current Ergo protocol is formed by semantically valid header fields and corresponding block sections (including transactions), with miners searching for a nonce such that the Autolykos Proof-of-Work function applied to the block header bytes (including nonce) is less than the Proof-of-Work target."

For example, by setting:\n  ```\n  t = T/64\n  ```\n  and defining the input block condition as:\n  ```\n  H(ib) < t\n  ```\n  a miner can generate, on average, 63 input blocks alongside 1 ordering block per ordering block generation period. Unlike superblocks, input blocks are not required to pass the ordering block PoW check, though every ordering block must pass the input block check.\n  \n- **Blockchain Structure:**  \n  The resulting blockchain may look like:\n  ```\n  (ordering block) - input block - input block - input block - (ordering block) - input block - input block - (ordering block) \u2026\n  ```\n  This structure facilitates rapid transaction dissemination while preserving overall network security.\n\n##.
