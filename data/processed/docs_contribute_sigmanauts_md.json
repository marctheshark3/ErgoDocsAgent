As SigCANs contribute and demonstrate their abilities, they can progress to become full-fledged Sigmanauts with greater responsibility. The program provides comprehensive training, fosters collaboration and networking, and manages the Sigmanauts Mining Pool. Since its launch, the Sigmanauts Program has achieved several milestones, including the launch of the Sigmanauts website, the Sigmanauts Mining Pool, and the management of the Ergo Foundation Twitter account.",
