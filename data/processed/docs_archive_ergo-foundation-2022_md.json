This focus is recognised and supported by the Ergo Foundation.\n\nThe Ergo Foundation is committed to organic and non-breaking development of the Ergo Platform protocol. The Foundation ensures that protocol changes are approved not only by miners - who express their will directly on the blockchain - but also by users and projects building on top of Ergo. \n\nThe Ergo Foundation is committed to maximising the number of valuable ecosystem developments accomplished in open-source with the least permissive licence possible.\n\nThe Foundation is also dedicated to helping with building trustless environments, smart contracts and payment frameworks for the public with privacy in mind. The Foundation believes that the Treasury should be distributed mainly to the community, including freelancers, hackers, experts and enthusiasts."

While the EF strives to lay the foundations and help ignite community marketing and, subsequently, compounding growth, beyond this, the marketing and promotion of Ergo rest principally on the shoulders of the community. [(Get Involved!)](contribute.md)\n\nThe EF does not commonly pay for influencers or ad campaigns and does its best to restrict frivolous spending, which is deemed not cost-effective  (i.e. airdrops, giveaways).\n\nThe marketing department highlights projects building in the ecosystem. However, these initiatives do not constitute an endorsement from the Ergo Foundation. The Foundation will always use best practices to vet projects and ensure that there is no risk for potential users. Still, in the early stages of development, it is often unknowable if anything of substance will ultimately be produced."

      "heading": "Exchanges",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "One of the primary reasons the Ergo Foundation exists is to act as a legal entity to deal with centralised exchanges. Since genesis, Ergo has been listed on several exchanges, including three *Tier 1* exchanges (KuCoin, gate.io, Huobi). \n\nA *tier 1* exchange is defined as an exchange that appears in the top 10 of exchange ranking sites such as [defillama.com/cexs](https://defillama.com/cexs)\n\nExchange discussions and details are always under Non-Disclosure Agreement ('NDA'). To clear up some misconceptions, we can release the following details.\n\n- Listings are usually expensive. \n- Exchanges do not buy liquidity or any of the native tokens or coins on the open market generally. Instead, we use a third-party Market Maker ('MM'), which has access to an API with a preallocated amount of ERG and USDT it uses to create a liquid market. The MM can only buy/sell and lacks the credentials to withdraw assets. \n- All major exchanges have been approached, and the EF has not rejected any exchanges due to them being too expensive.   \n\n**\u2018But why is coin x listed?\u2019**\n\nPossible reasons include the following:\n\n- They are a native asset on an already integrated chain (i.e., ERC20, Cosmos, etc.). Therefore, very little work is required to add and maintain a new chain here.\n- For Layer 1's:\n    - Have venture-capitalist funding and connections, which they can utilise to get listed early. \n    - Have a smaller public distribution than ERG and can bargain with exchanges for a percentage of their total supply. \n    - Are less complex than Ergo, with no native asset support, no need to worry about UTXO dust, etc. \n    - They may be older than Ergo and were listed during the last bear. \n    - Even though they are a unique Layer-1, they may only have a wrapped asset (i.e., on BSC) listed. \n\nYou can follow along on our [Weekly AMAs](https://www.youtube.com/@ErgoPlatform/streams) to catch any hints regarding the current exchange listing efforts."
