  "summary": "Proxy contracts are a smart contract pattern used on Ergo for secure dApp interactions. They act as intermediaries, allowing users to interact with dApps in a controlled and secure manner. The concept gained prominence with tools like the Ergo Assembler, enabling early dApps to function effectively. Proxy contracts provide a secure \"spending script\" that users can send funds to, which then interacts with the target dApp based on predefined rules. The design of proxy contracts has evolved to address potential vulnerabilities, with key principles being fund safety and dApp integrity. For detailed technical specifications, refer to the Ergo Improvement Proposal EIP-0017: Proxy Contracts.",

This enabled early dApps such as [Ergo Auction House](https://ergoauctions.org/), [ErgoUtils](https://ergoutils.org/), and the [SigmaUSD web interface](https://sigmausd.io/#/) to function effectively even before the widespread availability of wallet connectors similar to Ethereum's MetaMask.\n\nProxy contracts essentially provide a secure \"spending script\" that users can send funds to. This script then interacts with the target dApp based on predefined rules, ensuring the user's funds are only used as intended for that specific dApp interaction."

      "heading": "Key Design Principles",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "When designing or interacting with proxy contracts, developers and users should prioritize security:\n\n*   **Fund Safety:** The contract logic must rigorously prevent the dApp developer, the proxy contract creator, or any third party from misappropriating the user's funds. The contract should only allow spending according to the dApp's intended logic and the user's explicit action.\n*   **dApp Integrity:** The proxy contract should not introduce new attack vectors. It must protect against manipulation that could compromise the underlying dApp's state or logic (e.g., preventing replay attacks or unexpected state changes)."
