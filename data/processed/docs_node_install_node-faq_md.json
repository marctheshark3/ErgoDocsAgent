  "title": "Ergo Node FAQ & Guidelines",
  "summary": "The document provides an FAQ and guidelines for running an Ergo node. It covers the general benefits of running a node, how to view public nodes, and the minimum requirements for running a node, including Java version and hardware specifications. It also provides instructions for safely shutting down a node using API commands or terminating the ports. The document emphasizes the importance of running a node to contribute to the security of the Ergo network.",
  "qa_pairs": [
    {
      "question": "What are the benefits of running an Ergo node?",
      "answer": "There is no direct financial incentive to run a node. However, doing so contributes to increasing the security of the network."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Ergo nodes be viewed publicly?",
      "answer": "Yes, public nodes can be viewed at ergonodes.net. However, unless your node is hosted on a publicly accessible web-server, your node should be protected by your router."

    {
      "question": "How can you run a public Ergo node?",
      "answer": "To run a public node, refer to the nginx.conf example provided in the document."

      "question": "What are the risks of using a remote Ergo node?",
      "answer": "Be cautious when using a remote node as it can be insecure."

Specifically, the API should not be accessible from the Internet."
