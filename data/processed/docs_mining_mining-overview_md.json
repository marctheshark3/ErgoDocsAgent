  "summary": "The document provides an overview of mining on the Ergo blockchain, which is based on the Autolykos ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm. It covers the basics of getting started with Ergo mining, including joining a mining pool or solo mining, setting up wallets, and understanding the Autolykos algorithm and related concepts like SmartPools and subpooling. The document also includes links to community spaces like Discord, Telegram, and Reddit, as well as useful mining utilities such as a breakeven price calculator, difficulty and epoch monitor, and the Ergo Explorer.",
  "qa_pairs": [
    {
      "question": "What is the Autolykos algorithm?",
      "answer": "Autolykos is an ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm written in Scala that is used for Ergo mining."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the recommended mining options for Ergo?",
      "answer": "The recommended mining options are joining a mining pool or solo mining if you have 1%+ of the network hash rate."
