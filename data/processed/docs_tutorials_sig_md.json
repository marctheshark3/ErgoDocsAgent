  "title": "3-out-of-5 Threshold Signature",
  "summary": "The document describes a 3-out-of-5 threshold signature, which is a type of multi-signature contract in the Ergo blockchain. This allows any 3 out of 5 specified public keys to authorize a transaction from a single address, providing a way to create a \"ring spending contract\" where multiple parties can access the funds without revealing which one is spending. The document provides an example of the ErgoScript code for such a threshold signature and links to a tutorial on creating signatures. The key points are the use of threshold signatures for privacy-preserving multi-party access to funds in Ergo.",

That is not possible with Bitcoin, and while Ethereum can, it would be expensive and complicated \u2013 especially with a ring size of 10 or 20 members, required for robust privacy.\n\nWith Ergo, this kind of application can be created quickly, thanks to integrating Sigma protocols in the core that enables **self-sovereign application-level privacy**: trustless scripts that can be used to access mixers or other functionality without any third parties required.\n\n```scala\nval ringScript = s\"\"\"\n{\natLeast(\n  3, \n  Coll(\n    PK(\"9f8ZQt1Sue6W5ACdMSPRzsHj3jjiZkbYy3CEtB4BisxEyk4RsNk\"), \n    PK(\"9hFWPyhCJcw4KQyCGu4yAGfC1ieRAKyFg24FKjLJK2uDgA873uq\"), \n    PK(\"9fdVP2jca1e5nCTT6q9ijZLssGj6v4juY8gEAxUhp7YTuSsLspS\"), \n    PK(\"9gAKeRu1W4Dh6adWXnnYmfqjCTnxnSMtym2LPPMPErCkusCd6F3\"),\n    PK(\"9gmNsqrqdSppLUBqg2UzREmmivgqh1r3jmNcLAc53hk3YCvAGWE\")\n  )\n)\n}\n```\n\nThe above is an example `3-out-of-5` **threshold signature**, which can be compiled to a `P2S` address. \n\nSending ergs to the [resulting address](https://wallet.plutomonkey.com/p2s/?source=ewphdExlYXN0KAogIDMsIAogIENvbGwoCiAgICBQSygiOWY4WlF0MVN1ZTZXNUFDZE1TUFJ6c0hqM2pqaVprYll5M0NFdEI0QmlzeEV5azRSc05rIiksIAogICAgUEsoIjloRldQeWhDSmN3NEtReUNHdTR5QUdmQzFpZVJBS3lGZzI0RktqTEpLMnVEZ0E4NzN1cSIpLCAKICAgIFBLKCI5ZmRWUDJqY2ExZTVuQ1RUNnE5aWpaTHNzR2o2djRqdVk4Z0VBeFVocDdZVHVTc0xzcFMiKSwgCiAgICBQSygiOWdBS2VSdTFXNERoNmFkV1hublltZnFqQ1RueG5TTXR5bTJMUFBNUEVyQ2t1c0NkNkYzIiksCiAgICBQSygiOWdtTnNxcnFkU3BwTFVCcWcyVXpSRW1taXZncWgxcjNqbU5jTEFjNTNoazNZQ3ZBR1dFIikKICApCikKfQ==) (protected by the threshold sig).\n\nHere is a good introduction to [making a signature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daP67yp-Czs&list=PLUWruihtE-HtL-JZk8Vb4Yn_H18aE3rb6&index=4)."
