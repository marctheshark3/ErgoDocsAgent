  "title": "Hardware Wallet Integration with sigma-rust",
  "summary": "This document provides guidance for integrating Ergo support into hardware wallets using the sigma-rust library. Key challenges include the need for no_std compatibility, limited resources on hardware wallets, and dependency management. Strategies include using the sigma-rust-mini fork, replacing cryptographic backends to leverage the hardware wallet's optimized secp256k1 implementation, and minimizing dependencies. The essential functionality to port includes key derivation, address generation, transaction parsing, signing, and ErgoTree serialization/hashing. Collaboration within the developer community is crucial for advancing hardware wallet support for Ergo.",

The standard [`sigma-rust`](sigma-rust.md) library, while comprehensive, relies on Rust's standard library (`std`) and certain dependencies that might be too heavy or unsuitable for embedded environments.\n\nThis guide provides developers with pointers and strategies for adapting `sigma-rust` functionality for hardware wallet integration, based on community discussions and efforts."

      "content": "*   **No `std`:** Hardware wallets typically run bare-metal or on a minimal RTOS, lacking Rust's standard library (`std`). Code must be compatible with `no_std`.\n*   **Limited Resources:** Memory (RAM and flash) and CPU cycles are scarce. Libraries and cryptographic operations must be efficient.\n*   **Dependency Bloat:** Large dependencies can quickly exceed storage limits.\n*   **Cryptographic Primitives:** Hardware wallets often have optimized, built-in implementations of core cryptographic primitives (like secp256k1) that should ideally be leveraged instead of pulling in separate library implementations."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "A community fork/effort, often referred to as `sigma-rust-mini`, aims to provide a `no_std`-compatible subset of `sigma-rust`.\n\n*   **Repository (Example Fork):** [github.com/Alesfatalis/sigma-rust-mini/tree/no_std](https://github.com/Alesfatalis/sigma-rust-mini/tree/no_std) (Note: Check for the latest official or community-maintained versions).\n*   **`no_std` Feature Flag:** When using such forks or potentially future versions of `sigma-rust`, look for a `no_std` feature flag in `Cargo.toml` to enable compatibility. This typically excludes parts of the library relying on `std`."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "`sigma-rust` often uses the [`k256`](https://crates.io/crates/k256) crate for secp256k1 operations. Hardware wallets usually have their own optimized `secp256k1` implementations (often using the [`secp256k1`](https://crates.io/crates/secp256k1) crate or a C library). To avoid duplicate code and leverage hardware optimizations, you'll likely need to:\n\n*   **Fork `sigma-rust` (or `sigma-rust-mini`):** Modify the necessary parts of the library to use the hardware wallet's preferred `secp256k1` backend instead of `k256`.\n*   **Focus Areas:** Pay close attention to areas involving key generation, signing, verification, and Diffie-Hellman operations.\n*   **Key Types:** When working with the `secp256k1` crate, you'll typically use types like:\n    *   `secp256k1::SecretKey`\n    *   `secp256k1::PublicKey`\n    *   `secp256k1::ecdsa::Signature`\n*   **Relevant Methods (Hints from Dev Chat):** Community members have pointed towards needing methods like:\n    *   `PublicKey::mul_tweak`: For operations related to key derivation or tweaking.\n    *   `PublicKey::combine`: For combining public keys (e.g., in multi-sig or aggregated signatures).\n    *   Consult the [`secp256k1` crate documentation](https://docs.rs/secp256k1/latest/secp256k1/) for details on using its API."

This might involve:\n\n*   Using feature flags to disable unused functionality.\n*   Replacing crates with lighter-weight or `no_std` alternatives where possible.\n*   Potentially re-implementing certain non-cryptographic helper functions if their dependencies are problematic."

This is the most critical part and must use the hardware wallet's secure key storage and signing mechanism.\n*   **ErgoTree Serialization/Hashing:** Potentially needed for constructing parts of the transaction message to be signed."

      "heading": "Conclusion",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Integrating Ergo with hardware wallets requires careful adaptation of existing libraries like `sigma-rust`. Leveraging `no_std` compatible forks/versions, replacing cryptographic backends to use the device's optimized implementations (like `secp256k1`), and minimizing dependencies are key strategies. This is a complex task often requiring deep knowledge of both the Ergo protocol and embedded Rust development. Collaboration within the developer community is crucial for advancing hardware wallet support."
