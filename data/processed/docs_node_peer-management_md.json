  "summary": "The document describes the Peer Management Protocol, which is used to manage the set of known peers in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. The key points are:\n\n- A peer is identified by an IP address and port number.\n- The peer management structure consists of three sets: good peers, banned peers, and connected peers, which adhere to certain invariants.\n- Peers can be penalized for various types of misbehavior, and penalties are tracked in a penalty book. Excessive penalization is prevented by a cooldown period.\n- Peers with accumulated penalties above a threshold are added to a blacklist, which can be temporary or permanent.\n- Peer discovery aims to find new potential peers from various sources and add them to the set of good peers.",

      "question": "What is the key structure used to represent the peer management within a node?",
      "answer": "(G, B, C), where G is the set of known good peers, B is the set of banned peers, and C is the set of currently connected peers."

      "question": "How are penalties stored and managed in the peer management protocol?",
      "answer": "Penalties are stored in a penalty book that maps an IP address to its current accumulated penalty score and the timestamp of the last penalty event."

    {
      "question": "What are the sources for discovering new potential peers in the peer discovery protocol?",
      "answer": "Other connected peers, predefined bootstrap nodes, trusted central servers, and potentially untrusted channels like DNS seeds, IRC, and Twitter."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key invariants that the peer management structure must adhere to?",
      "answer": "The sets of good peers and banned peers are disjoint, the set of connected peers is a subset of the good peers, and both the good and banned peer sets are subsets of the set of all possible peers."

      "content": "A **penalty** is represented as a tuple (`descr`, `score`), where `descr` describes the type of misbehavior, and `score` quantifies its severity.\n\nThere are four categories of penalties:\n\n* **NonDeliveryPenalty**: Applied when a peer fails to deliver a requested modifier within the expected timeframe.\n* **MisbehaviorPenalty**: Applied when a peer delivers an invalid modifier (e.g., one failing validation rules).\n* **SpamPenalty**: Applied when a peer delivers an unsolicited modifier (one that was not requested).\n* **PermanentPenalty**: Applied for severe protocol deviations, resulting in an immediate and permanent ban.\n\nWhen a penalty is imposed, the penalized peer's information is updated in the **penalty book**. The penalty book maps an IP address (`ip`) to its current accumulated penalty `score` and the timestamp (`ts`) of the last penalty event: `ip` -> (`score`, `ts`).\n\nTo prevent excessive penalization for transient issues, penalties of type `NonDeliveryPenalty`, `MisbehaviorPenalty`, and `SpamPenalty` are not applied repeatedly to the same peer within a defined **safe interval** (a cooldown period between penalties).\n\nWhen a peer's accumulated `score` reaches a predefined critical threshold, the peer is added to the **blacklist**. The blacklist maps a banned peer's IP address (`ip`) to the timestamp (`ts`) when the ban was initiated: `ip` -> `ts`. Peers typically remain on the blacklist for a configurable duration, after which they might be removed and potentially re-added to the set of good peers.\n\nApplying a `PermanentPenalty`, however, results in the peer being added to the blacklist indefinitely."
