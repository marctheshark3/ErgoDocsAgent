  "summary": "Lending and borrowing are important components that increase liquidity flow in financial systems. Crypto lending protocols like Compound allow users to lend and borrow without the need for centralized platforms. These protocols can offer innovative features like interest-free loans, which can be attractive to miners and other users. The document also mentions specific examples of lending contracts on the Ergo platform, such as the \"interest-free loan contract\" and the \"targeted microloan contract\" from the \"Smart Contracts for the People\" article.",

      "content": "Lending and borrowing are two components that increase liquidity flow in financial systems. For example, you have Bitcoins but want to leverage your holding without selling your BTC. So, you can stake your BTC (you can also use your house as collateral in this sense) as collateral to borrow SigUSD and use it in exchanges or yield farming protocols. On the other side of your interaction, another user can leverage her unused SigUSD by staking in the lending protocol. Traditional banks have very low-interest rates, and they might suck up a lot of revenue from your deposits. With decentral lending protocols such as [Compound](https://compound.finance/), users will be able to use lend/borrow services and move their funds across all crypto ecosystems without any need for centralized platforms such as banks or exchanges. Crypto lending protocols are open to more experimental designs, such as [interest-free loans](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/interest-free-loan-contract/67), innovating even more use cases on blockchains.\n\n\n* Loans: we have an [interest-free loan contract example](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/interest-free-loan-contract/67) \n* With SigmaUSD, loans can be attractive to miners and not only.\n* Please also check the targeted microloan contract from [\"Smart Contracts for the People\" article](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2018_10_19-smart-contracts/)"
