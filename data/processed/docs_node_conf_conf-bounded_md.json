  "title": "Bounded Mailbox Configuration",
  "summary": "The document describes the \"bounded-mailbox\" configuration, which limits the maximum number of messages that can be stored in an actor's mailbox. It specifies the mailbox type as \"NonBlockingBoundedMailbox\", which provides a capacity-constrained, non-blocking, and thread-safe message queue. The mailbox capacity is set to 5000 messages, and once this limit is reached, the mailbox refuses to accept more messages until space becomes available. This configuration helps control the load on the actor system and ensures the resilience and stability of the system.",
