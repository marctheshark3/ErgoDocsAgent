The main frameworks mentioned are AppKit, SigmaRust, and Fleet SDK, which cater to different programming languages and use cases. Other frameworks like ergpy, Mosaik, RustKit, Headless dApp Framework, and JSON dApp Environment are also briefly described.",

      "question": "What is SigmaRust?",
      "answer": "SigmaRust is an alternative and simple implementation of ErgoTree interpreter and transaction building tools."

The Ergo HDF provides developers with the first portable UTXO-based headless dApp development framework on any blockchain.\n- [JSON dApp Environment](jde.md)"
