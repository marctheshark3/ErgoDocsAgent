    {
      "question": "What are NiPoPoWs in Ergo?",
      "answer": "NiPoPoWs, or Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work, are compact data structures that validate blockchain events without needing full network connectivity or downloading all block headers. They enable efficient light clients, log-space mining, and trustless sidechains."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the storage rent (demurrage) mechanism in Ergo?",
      "answer": "The storage rent, or demurrage, mechanism in Ergo mitigates blockchain bloat and turns it into a profitable venture by charging for on-chain storage."
