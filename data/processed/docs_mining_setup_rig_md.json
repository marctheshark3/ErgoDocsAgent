  "summary": "Building a Mining Rig: The document outlines the key components required to build a mining rig for the Ergo cryptocurrency. The main components include a graphics card (GPU), motherboard, power supply, processor (CPU), memory (RAM), and storage. The document also mentions other hardware like GPU risers, CPU cooler, mining rack, and fans. The document provides a link to a resource that can help estimate the potential hashrate of the GPU, which indicates the mining efficiency of the rig.",

      "content": "-   [Graphics Card (GPU)](https://ergonaut.space/en/Guides/Mining/Graphics_Cards): The GPU is the most important component of a mining rig. It's responsible for solving the complex mathematical problems that validate transactions on the Ergo network.\n-   Motherboards (MOBO): The motherboard is the main circuit board of your mining rig. It's where all other components are connected.\n-   Power Supply (PSU): The power supply provides electricity to your mining rig. Make sure to choose a PSU with enough capacity to support all your components.\n-   Processor (CPU): While not as important as the GPU for mining, the CPU handles the rest of your rig's operations.\n-   Memory (RAM): RAM is your rig's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that your CPU uses while operating.\n-   Storage (USB, SSD, HDD): Your rig's storage is where the operating system and mining software are installed.\n-   Other Hardware\n    -   GPU Risers: These allow you to connect multiple GPUs to your motherboard.\n    -   CPU Cooler: This keeps your CPU's temperature down.\n    -   Mining Rack: A mining rack helps you organize your rig in a safe and efficient manner.\n    -   Fans: Fans are necessary to keep your rig's temperature down.\n\nOnce you've chosen your components, you can check the potential hashrate of your GPU [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsuoDB27EwCo_BlSjCP3GMLfTSJRPIWIBsL-wPTllUg). This will give you an idea of how effective your rig will be at mining Ergo."
