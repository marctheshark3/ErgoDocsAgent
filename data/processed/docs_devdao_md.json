  "summary": "The Developer DAO (DevDAO) is a decentralized autonomous organization focused on research, development, and maintenance of the Ergo protocol and its associated infrastructure. The DevDAO aims to promote transparency, scalability, and community involvement in the core development efforts of the Ergo ecosystem.\n\nThe scope of the DevDAO includes research, core development, infrastructure, and the development of various DeFi tools and applications on the Ergo platform. The DevDAO's vision is to establish Ergo as Digital Gold 2.0, a mineable digital commodity with trustless derivatives and expressive contracts.\n\nThe DevDAO has already made significant progress in developing Ergo's infrastructure and DeFi ecosystem, including launching wallets, explorers, and a wide range of DeFi tools. Looking ahead, the DevDAO plans to launch new DeFi tools, implement sidechains, expand Ergo's contractual layer, and experiment with scalability solutions.\n\nTo ensure the sustainability and growth of the Ergo ecosystem, the DevDAO is exploring monetization strategies such as receiving a percentage of sidechain token emissions and offering consultancy services. The DevDAO has several committees to track the achievement of its goals, which include organizing discussions, finding funding, maintaining infrastructure, and supporting the needs of dApps and wallets.\n\nThe DevDAO is funded by the Ergo Foundation, projects on Ergo, and crypto funds.",

This includes launching basic infrastructure such as wallets and explorers, as well as a wide range of DeFi tools and trustless derivatives, such as:\n\n- SigmaUSD stablecoin (Djed protocol)\n- Spectrum DEX (AMM-based)\n- ErgoMixer (non-interactive, non-custodial mixer)\n- ErgoAuctionHouse (peer-to-peer auctions)\n- SigmaFi (peer-to-peer loans via bonds)\n- Duckpools (lending pools)\n- ErgoRaffle (decentralized crowdfunding)\n- EXLE (uncollateralized lending)\n- SigmaO (trustless options)\n- HodlCoin (trustless ERG derivative with non-declining price)\n- AuctionCoin (emission via auctions)\n- Oracle Pools (federated transparent data providing)\n- Rosen Bridge (two-layered federated bridge)\n\nThese tools collectively contribute to the creation of more trustless collateral through various means such as AuctionCoin, OptionCoin, and fair initial mining offerings. As a result, Ergo's decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply continue to grow. It's worth noting that the entire DeFi ecosystem on Ergo is built upon its unique ErgoTree/ErgoScript contractual layer, also known as Sigma, which provides a secure and flexible foundation for the development of complex financial applications."
