  "summary": "This document outlines the detailed process for validating Merkle proofs in the Ergo blockchain. The validation process involves computing a series of hashes based on the provided proof elements and comparing the final result with the expected Merkle root. The steps include computing the leaf node hash, iterating through the proof levels, and comparing the final computed hash with the Merkle root. The document provides code implementations for each step and a flowchart to visualize the validation process. It also includes an example of validating a transaction's inclusion in an Ergo block using a Merkle proof. The document emphasizes the importance of Merkle proof validation in ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient verification without the need to download the entire blockchain.",

This is done by prepending a **1-byte zero prefix** to the leaf data and then hashing the result using the `Blake2b256` hash function.\n\n**Code Implementation**: The leaf node hash computation is implemented within the Ergo codebase, primarily found in the `scorex.crypto.authds.merkle` package of the [Scrypto](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto) library, which is used by Ergo.\n\n```scala\nval leafData = Base16.decode(txId).get\nval leafHash = Blake2b256(0.toByte +: leafData)\n```"

      "content": "The proof consists of multiple levels, each providing information about the position of the node within the Merkle tree and its sibling hash. For each level, the following steps are performed:\n\n- **Check the 1-Byte Prefix**:\n    - If the prefix is `0`, this indicates that the computed hash from the previous step should be on the left side.\n    - If the prefix is `1`, this indicates that the computed hash should be on the right side.\n    \n- **Compute the Hash for the Next Level**:\n    - Depending on the prefix, concatenate the computed hash from the previous step with the sibling hash and the prefix. Then, hash the concatenated result using `Blake2b256`.\n\n**Code Implementation**: The iteration process and validation logic are crucial for verifying the correctness of the Merkle proof. This is implemented in the [BatchMerkleProof.scala](https://github.com/input-output-hk/scrypto/blob/master/shared/src/main/scala/scorex/crypto/authds/merkle/BatchMerkleProof.scala) file in the `scrypto` repository.\n\n```scala\nval levels = Seq(\"0139b79af823a92aa72ced2c6d9e7f7f4687de5b5af7fab0ad205d3e54bda3f3ae\")\nval computedHash = levels.foldLeft(leafHash) { case (hash, level) =>\n    val bytes = Base16.decode(level).get\n    val prefix = bytes.head\n    val siblingHash = bytes.tail\n\n    val concatenated = if (prefix == 0.toByte) {\n        hash ++ siblingHash\n    } else {\n        siblingHash ++ hash\n    }\n\n    Blake2b256(prefix +: concatenated)\n}\n```"
