  "summary": "Ergo's Storage Rent System is a key strategy implemented to ensure the long-term economic sustainability of the Ergo blockchain. It is an 'on-chain garbage collection' mechanism that mitigates blockchain bloat and turns it into a profitable venture for miners. Storage rent is a minimal fee levied on unspent outputs (UTXOs) or 'boxes' after a period of four years of inactivity, with the fee per byte determined by the storage rent subprotocol. This amounts to approximately 0.14 ERG every four years for a typical box. The document also provides a link to a detailed guide on Ergo's storage rent system and how to consolidate a wallet.",

One of the key strategies we've implemented to ensure this is the concept of **Storage Rent**. This can be likened to an *'on-chain garbage collection'* mechanism that not only mitigates the issue of blockchain bloat but also turns it into a profitable venture for [miners](mining-overview.md).\n\nStorage rent is a minimal fee levied on [unspent output (UTXOs)](eutxo.md) or '[boxes](box.md)' after a period of four years of inactivity. The fee per byte is determined by the storage rent subprotocol. On average, this amounts to approximately 0.14 ERG every four years for a typical box.\n\nFor a more in-depth understanding of Ergo's storage rent system, please refer to this [detailed guide](rent.md).\n\n/// admonition | Guide\n    type: tip\n\n[How do I consolidate my wallet?](https://ergonaut.space/en/Guides/how-to-consolidate-a-wallet)\n///"
