  "summary": "The Ergo Foundation's initial role was to bootstrap the Ergo ecosystem and build the necessary infrastructure. This has led to a vibrant ecosystem with over 300 community developers, 100 active contributors, and over 140 projects developing on Ergo. \n\nAs the ecosystem matures, the Ergo Foundation's importance should diminish, and responsibility should transition towards the community. The Foundation may continue to exist as a legal entity to mitigate counterparty risk, but its focus will be on promoting blockchain technology for societal benefit, advocating for decentralized infrastructure, and upholding privacy. \n\nThe Sigmanauts Program is a grassroots initiative aimed at empowering individuals to take ownership of Ergo and shape its future, enabling the community to contribute to Ergo's development.",

This shift is essential for the ecosystem's strength and decentralization.\n\nThe Ergo Foundation may continue to exist indefinitely as a legal entity, primarily serving to mitigate counterparty risk in interactions with centralized entities. In the interim, it will continue to foster the development of applications and protocols that align with its foundational objectives:\n\n- Promoting blockchain technology for societal benefit\n- Advocating for truly decentralized infrastructure\n- Upholding privacy as a fundamental human right\n\nThe optimal strategy involves diligent work and the development of robust infrastructure to accommodate potential liquidity shifts from existing systems. Emphasis should be placed on user security, privacy, and long-term resilience. While the timing and nature of these shifts cannot be precisely predicted or controlled, strategic positioning can prepare us for various outcomes.\n\nThe generous contributions from ecosystem projects to the Foundation's [treasury](ef-treasury.md) ensure its sustainability, enabling it to fulfill this mission until it becomes redundant."
