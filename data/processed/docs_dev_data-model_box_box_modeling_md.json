These boxes are not just containers for the value of a currency within a blockchain; they are also equipped with [**registers**](registers.md) that are protected by a [contract](ergoscript.md), enhancing their functionality on the Ergo blockchain.\n\nRegisters are essentially storage units for data and information at specific [addresses](address.md) in the blockchain. To visualize this, think of these boxes as advanced storage units or containers. For instance, consider a cup:\n\n**A Cup:**\n\n- Holds liquid primarily\n- Can contain a certain quantity of liquid\n\nNow, let's translate this into a blockchain context:\n\n**A Cup Box:**\n\n- Stores only Ergs or a specific [token](tokens.md)\n- Has a storage limit enforced by a guard [script](ergoscript.md)\n\nA guard script or [smart contract](ergoscript.md) sets restrictions on the box. Without it, a box is just a storage unit for information or a certain amount of currency. The introduction of guard scripts, which establish specific rules for the boxes, adds a level of control and functionality to the boxes, much like a remote control. The focus here is not on the internal workings of a remote control (guard script) or the data it transmits (registers and storage), but on its functionality - pressing a button changes the TV channel."
