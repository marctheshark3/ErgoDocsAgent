  "summary": "Smart Contracts: ErgoScript is the smart contract language used by the Ergo blockchain. While it has concise syntax, it may seem unclear at first because it is conceptually different from conventional languages. Ergo is a UTXO-based blockchain, whereas smart contracts are traditionally associated with account-based systems like Ethereum. However, Ergo's transaction model has many advantages over the account-based model, and developing Ergo contracts can be significantly easier than writing and debugging Solidity code.\n\nThe key aspects that make the Ergo contract model different are: 1) Paradigm - Ergo's UTXO-based programming model is declarative, unlike Ethereum's imperative account model. 2) Scalability - Ergo transactions are created off-chain, and only validation checks are performed on-chain, reducing the number of operations performed by every node. 3) Shared state - Ergo's model is based on an immutable graph of transactions, unlike Ethereum's shared mutable state. 4) Expressive Power - Ergo extends UTXO to enable Turing completeness while limiting the complexity of the ErgoScript language itself.",

    {
      "question": "How does the Ergo contract model differ from the account-based model of Ethereum?",
      "answer": "Ergo's UTXO-based programming model is declarative, specifying conditions for a transaction to be accepted, rather than changing the balances in storage as a series of operations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Ergo contract model improve scalability compared to Ethereum?",
      "answer": "In Ergo, transactions are created off-chain, and only validation checks are performed on-chain, reducing the number of operations performed by every node on the network. Additionally, the immutability of the transaction graph allows for optimization strategies to improve transaction throughput."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the advantages of Ergo's UTXO-based model over the shared mutable state in the account-based model?",
      "answer": "Ergo's UTXO-based model, inherited from Bitcoin, plays well with the concurrent and distributed nature of blockchains and facilitates light trustless clients, avoiding the complex semantics and potential subtle bugs associated with shared mutable state."

    {
      "question": "Where can I find more resources on developing smart contracts using ErgoScript?",
      "answer": "The ErgoScript page provides an overview of all resources related to smart contract development, and the ErgoScript Primer offers a more detailed introduction to the language."

While it has concise syntax adopted from Scala/Kotlin, it may seem unclear at first because, conceptually, ErgoScript is quite different from conventional languages. Ergo is a UTXO-based blockchain, whereas smart contracts are traditionally associated with account-based systems like Ethereum. However, Ergo's transaction model has many advantages over the account-based model. With the right approach, developing Ergo contracts can be significantly easier than writing and debugging Solidity code.\n\nThe [ErgoScript](ergoscript.md) page provides an overview of all resources related to smart contract development.

      "content": "The account model of Ethereum is imperative. This means that the typical task of sending coins from Alice to Bob requires changing the balances in storage as a series of operations. Ergo's UTXO-based programming model, on the other hand, is declarative. ErgoScript contracts specify conditions for a transaction to be accepted by the blockchain (not changes to be made in the storage state due to the contract execution)."

      "heading": "Scalability",
      "level": 5,
      "content": "In the account model of Ethereum, both storage changes and validity checks are performed _on-chain_ during code execution. In contrast, Ergo transactions are created _off-chain_, and only validation checks are performed on-chain, thus reducing the number of operations performed by every node on the network. In addition, due to the immutability of the transaction graph, various optimization strategies can improve the throughput of transactions per second in the network. [Light verifying nodes](nipopow_nodes.md) are also possible, thus further facilitating scalability and accessibility of the network."

It theoretically promised unlimited potential; however, severe limitations arose from excessive [blockchain bloat](storage-rent.md), subtle multi-million dollar bugs, [gas costs](min-fee.md) that limit contract complexity, and other such problems. [Ergo](protocol-overview.md), in contrast, extends [UTXO](eutxo.md) to enable [Turing completeness](multi-stage-txs.md) while limiting the complexity of the [ErgoScript language](ergoscript.md) itself. The same expressive power is achieved in a different, more semantically sound manner."
