  "title": "Critical-Dispatcher Configuration Settings",
  "summary": "The document describes the configuration settings for the \"critical-dispatcher\", a dedicated actor dispatcher used exclusively by the block candidate generator and NodeViewHolder actors in the system. The key points are:\n\n- The dispatcher is of type \"Dispatcher\" and uses a \"thread-pool-executor\" mechanism to run tasks.\n- The thread pool has a fixed size of 2 threads.\n- The throughput is set to 1, meaning only 1 message is processed per actor before the thread is made available to other actors.\n- This configuration ensures critical tasks are allocated dedicated threads for efficient execution, isolated from non-critical activities.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of the critical-dispatcher?",
      "answer": "The critical-dispatcher is a dedicated actor dispatcher, utilized exclusively by the block candidate generator and NodeViewHolder actors within the system, to maintain critical tasks which require isolation from other non-critical activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of executor is configured for the critical-dispatcher?",
      "answer": "The critical-dispatcher is configured to use the \"thread-pool-executor\" as the executor."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many threads are in the thread pool for the critical-dispatcher?",
      "answer": "The fixed-pool-size for the critical-dispatcher is set to 2 threads."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the throughput setting for the critical-dispatcher?",
      "answer": "The throughput for the critical-dispatcher is set to 1, which means the maximum number of messages to be processed per actor before the thread is made available to other actors is 1."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key configuration settings for the critical-dispatcher?",
      "answer": "The key configuration settings for the critical-dispatcher are: type = Dispatcher, executor = \"thread-pool-executor\", fixed-pool-size = 2, and throughput = 1."
