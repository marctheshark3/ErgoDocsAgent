Ergo's block structure incorporates NIPoPoW links, allowing different types of nodes and clients to selectively download required block sections.\n\nNIPoPoWs facilitate the creation of efficient light clients, enable logarithmic space mining, and enable the construction of trustless proof-of-work sidechains. They also enable generic cross-chain communication, allowing smart contracts on one blockchain to receive and react to events on another blockchain.\n\nTo adopt NIPoPoWs, the source blockchain needs to support interlink structures, which can be added through a velvet fork.

      "question": "What is a Non-interactive Proof-of-Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoW)?",
      "answer": "NIPoPoWs is a cryptographic protocol that allows verifying that an event took place on a blockchain without requiring a direct network connection or downloading all block headers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do NIPoPoWs work?",
      "answer": "NIPoPoWs consist of a prover (a full node on the source blockchain) and a verifier (who does not have access to the full blockchain but knows its genesis block). The prover generates a short proof that convinces the verifier that an event occurred in the source blockchain."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the security assumption of NIPoPoWs?",
      "answer": "The security of NIPoPoWs relies on the honest majority assumption. The verifier accepts multiple proofs, and as long as at least one of them is honestly generated, the verifier can extract the correct information about the occurrence of the event."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Ergo's block structure support NIPoPoWs?",
      "answer": "Ergo's block structure incorporates an 'extension' section that houses NIPoPoW links, updated every 1,024 block epochs. This allows different types of nodes and clients to selectively download required block sections, optimizing storage, bandwidth, and CPU usage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a key application of NIPoPoWs?",
      "answer": "NIPoPoWs facilitate the creation of efficient light clients, enhancing the accessibility and scalability of blockchain networks. Light clients can operate without maintaining the entire blockchain, as they can verify the occurrence of events using succinct proofs."

NIPoPoWs allow verifying that an event took place without requiring a direct network connection or downloading all [block headers](block-header.md), making them particularly useful for [cross-chain communication](use-cases-overview.md#infrastructure), [sidechains](sidechains.md), and [light clients](light-spv-node.md)."

The prover is a [full node](archival-node.md) on the source blockchain, while the verifier does not have access to the full blockchain but knows its genesis block. The prover generates a short proof that convinces the verifier that an event occurred in the source blockchain. This proof is succinct, growing only polylogarithmically with the size of the blockchain.\n\nThe security of NIPoPoWs relies on the honest majority assumption. The verifier accepts multiple proofs, and as long as at least one of them is honestly generated, the verifier can extract the correct information about the occurrence of the event.\n\nErgo's [block structure](block.md) goes beyond the traditional header and transaction format, incorporating an ['extension' section](extension-section.md) that houses NIPoPoW links, updated every 1,024 block epochs. This unique structure allows different types of [nodes](modes.md) and clients to selectively download required block sections, optimizing storage, bandwidth, and CPU usage."

This approach can be integrated through [velvet (soft) forks](velvet-fork.md), avoiding [hard fork](hard-fork.md) complexities."

They can be used to transfer assets from one blockchain to another and back, implementing a two-way peg. The security of the sidechain construction relies on the security of the underlying NIPoPoW protocol.\n\nNIPoPoWs leverage Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs to provide resistance against potential attacks while maintaining a small size for efficient network transmission. This novel technology opens up new possibilities for [interoperability](use-cases-overview.md#infrastructure) between blockchains."

The target blockchain must be able to run the NIPoPoW verification function, which can be implemented in a Turing-complete language such as Solidity.\n\n[Miners](mining-overview.md) and full nodes of the target blockchain do not need to be aware of the source blockchain, as they treat the NIPoPoW proofs as opaque strings passed to a smart contract. This blockchain agnosticism allows users to initiate cross-chain relationships between different blockchains dynamically."
