  "summary": "The document provides a comparison of different stablecoins, including SigmaUSD, MakerDAO's DAI, and Terra's UST. It highlights the advantages of SigmaUSD, such as no liquidations, over-collateralization, and explicit peg breaking point. The document also provides an overview of fiat-collateralized stablecoins like Tether, USDC, TrueUSD, and Paxos Standard, discussing their key features and characteristics.",

      "question": "How is the stability of SigmaUSD different from that of UST?",
      "answer": "SigmaUSD is over-collateralized, with every SigUSD backed by $3, while the breaking point of the UST peg is unclear."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the key difference between the collateral ratios of SigmaUSD and Terra's stablecoin system?",
      "answer": "The collateral ratio for SigmaUSD is higher, meaning better capital efficiency, but Terra's system needs an additional mechanism to ensure stability when the collateral (Luna) value drops."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Luna supply dependency affect the stability of Terra's stablecoin system compared to SigmaUSD?",
      "answer": "The Luna supply depends on Terra usage, which can lead to Luna price pumping when the trend is up but dumping harder when the trend is down, creating a risk of a bank run."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the key benefit of SigmaUSD's explicit peg breaking point compared to the uncertainty in Terra's stablecoin system?",
      "answer": "With SigmaUSD, the breaking point of the peg is explicit and open for anyone to see, which stops a bank run at its inception, while with Terra's system, no one knows at which price point the trust in the protocol disappears."

The reason for this is the vulnerability of CDP-based protocols in terms of high volatility and blockchain congestion. As Emurgo states, \"Black Thursday,\" when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed.

The breaking point of the peg is explicit and open for anyone to see. With UST, you have no idea, which gives you an incentive to get out first.\n\n\n- Luna supply depends on terra usage; Ergo does not. Burning luna when the trend is up pumps its price. However, the luna price will dump harder when the trend is down because more luna is printed. \n\n- collateral ratio for sigusd is higher. This means that the capital efficiency (less collateral tied for each stablecoin) is better for terra, which is why luna/terra can offer a better yield. \n\nHowever, this means luna/terra needs an additional mechanism to ensure stability. When collateral (luna) value drops, someone needs to stabilise it. Those people are incentivised with promises of larger profits in the future. This assumes that people will always believe that the protocol survives the crash. No one knows at which price point luna the trust disappears. This creates a seed for a bank run. Everyone wants to take their stablecoin out faster than others if there is any doubt.\n\nIn contrast, sigusd shows explicitly when the peg will be lost. No one needs to guess how long the protocol can last."

It focuses on addressing the capital inefficiencies identified in the case of stablecoins such as DAI. FEI presents stark differences in comparison to other algorithm-based stablecoins. One of the foremost differences refers to the fact that it does not feature the mechanism for swapping collateral for stablecoin. On the contrary, digital wealth comes into the system by leveraging a bonding curve, which sells FEI in exchange for ETH. Then, the digital wealth remains locked in the Protocol Controlled Value or PCV, which is basically the pool of collateral for the stablecoin.\n\n> PCV helps in maintaining the peg by managing liquidity on exchanges like Uniswap. With the limitations on sell-side liquidity, FEI is one of the best algorithmic stablecoins for avoiding the \u2018death spiral\u2019 scenario.
