  "title": "Ring Signatures in Ergo",
  "summary": "The document provides an overview of ring signatures in the Ergo blockchain. Ring signatures are a privacy-preserving cryptographic technique that allows a user to sign a transaction on behalf of a group without revealing the specific signer. Key features include anonymity, privacy, and flexible composition through Ergo's Sigma protocols. Use cases include anonymous transactions, decentralized mixers, and confidential voting. The technical implementation in Ergo leverages Sigma protocols to prove knowledge of one secret from a set of secrets, obfuscating the true signer. The document also discusses related cryptographic concepts, privacy mechanisms, and advanced applications of ring signatures in the Ergo ecosystem.",
