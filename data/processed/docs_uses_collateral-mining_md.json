  "summary": "Collateral Mining is a unique feature of the Ergo Blockchain that provides an innovative approach to mining and incentivizes participation in the network. It allows miners to utilize their collateral as a stake to participate in the mining process. The architecture consists of a collateral box script that defines three main cases for receiving mining rewards: block mined by the miner, collateral top-up by anyone, and collateral withdrawal by the miner. The primary limitation is that only one unspent collateral box can exist at a time for a given miner public key. The pool reward can be adjusted to provide additional incentives, and miners also receive all transaction fees associated with the blocks they mine. The document provides additional resources for further understanding and engagement with Collateral Mining on the Ergo Blockchain.",

    {
      "question": "What are the three main cases that determine the eligibility for receiving rewards in Collateral Mining?",
      "answer": "The three main cases are: 1) Block Mined by Alice, 2) Collateral Top-Up, and 3) Block Mined by Others."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the conditions for a successful Collateral Top-Up?",
      "answer": "The conditions are: 1) The first output of the block should have the same proposition bytes as SELF, 2) The creation height of the first output should be greater than or equal to the creation height of the current box, and 3) The value of the first output should be greater than the value of SELF."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Collateral Mining architecture work?",
      "answer": "The Collateral Mining architecture consists of a collateral box script, which governs the rules and conditions for mining rewards."

      "question": "What are the key features of Collateral Mining?",
      "answer": "Collateral Mining offers an alternative to traditional mining pools and provides a secure and efficient method for miners to contribute their computational power to the Ergo Blockchain network."

      "heading": "Limitations and Considerations",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The primary limitation of Collateral Mining is that only one unspent collateral box can exist at a time for a given miner public key. This restriction prevents a pool from spending multiple boxes in the same block and claiming a multiple of the reward. Although this limitation exists, we believe it is reasonable and avoids the complexity associated with miners creating special signatures to address this issue. To mitigate any potential concerns, the top-up mechanism (case 2) enables anyone to contribute additional collateral to a specific box.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the pool reward, initially set at 67.5 ERG, can be adjusted to provide additional incentives. However, it is important to mention that miners already receive all transaction fees associated with the blocks they mine."
