  "summary": "The document discusses the Akka configuration settings, which manage how the application uses the Akka framework for concurrency and actor-based programming. It covers the HTTP server settings, including the request timeout, maximum connections, and HTTP request parsing settings, such as the maximum URI length. These settings are crucial for managing server performance, availability, and security, and should be adjusted carefully based on the application's requirements and potential risks.",

      "question": "Where are the HTTP server settings located in the Akka configuration?",
      "answer": "The HTTP server settings are located under the `http.server` category."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the `request-timeout` setting in the Akka configuration?",
      "answer": "The `request-timeout` setting specifies the maximum duration the server will wait for a request to be completed before it times out."

      "question": "What is the default value for the `request-timeout` setting in the Akka configuration?",
      "answer": "The `request-timeout` is set to 1 minute in the provided configuration."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the `max-connections` setting in the Akka configuration?",
      "answer": "The `max-connections` setting indicates the maximum number of connections the server can maintain concurrently."

      "heading": "Request Timeout",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "```conf\nrequest-timeout = 1 minute\n```\nThe `request-timeout` setting specifies the maximum duration the server will wait for a request to be completed before it times out. In this configuration, the timeout is set to 1 minute. This setting is crucial to prevent the system from waiting indefinitely for a response, which could impact performance or availability."

    {
      "heading": "Maximum Connections",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "```conf\nmax-connections = 128\n```\nThe `max-connections` setting indicates the maximum number of connections the server can maintain concurrently. In this configuration, the limit is set to 128 connections. This ensures the server can handle multiple requests simultaneously without overloading its resources."

    {
      "heading": "Maximum URI Length",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "```conf\nmax-uri-length = 8192\n```\nThe `max-uri-length` setting determines the maximum length of the URI that the server will accept. In this configuration, the limit is set to 8192 characters. This setting is crucial to prevent potential buffer overflow attacks and keep the server secure."

Adjust these settings carefully, considering both your application's requirements and potential risks."
