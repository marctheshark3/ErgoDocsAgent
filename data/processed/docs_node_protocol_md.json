It covers the following key areas:\n\n- **Processing Algorithm**: This section explains the algorithm used for processing Ergo [modifiers](modifiers-processing.md). It is applicable across all [security modes](modes.md) within the Ergo network, ensuring consistent data processing.\n\n- **Validation Rules**: This part outlines the consensus-critical [validation rules](modifiers-validation.md). These rules are mandatory for every [node](install.md) in the Ergo network to maintain network integrity and security. They ensure that all [transactions](transactions.md) and [blocks](block.md) adhere to the established network standards.\n\n- **P2P Protocol**: The [P2P Protocol](p2p-protocol-overview.md) section delves into the [peer-to-peer](p2p-protocol-overview.md) protocol used in the Ergo network. It provides insights into how nodes communicate and share information, facilitating efficient data exchange within the network.\n\n- **Peer Management**: The [peer management](peer-management.md) section discusses the strategies nodes in the Ergo network employ to manage their peers. It includes information about peer discovery, connection, and disconnection, providing a clear understanding of how nodes maintain network connectivity.\n\nBy understanding these aspects, you can gain a deeper insight into how the Ergo network operates, ensuring its security and efficiency."
