Set up a [wallet](wallets.md) where your mining payouts will be deposited.\n3. Select a [mining pool](pools.md) to join or look into [solo mining](solo.md)\n4. Consider [overclocking](overclocking.md) your GPU to maximize your mining performance. Be aware that this can increase power consumption and potentially shorten the lifespan of your hardware.\n5. Check out the [Miner Tooling](miner-tooling.md) and keep an eye on ways to participate in [miner governance](governance.md) in future.\n\nHappy mining!"
