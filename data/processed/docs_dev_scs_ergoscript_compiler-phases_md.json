  "summary": "This document provides an overview of the key phases in the ErgoScript compiler pipeline, including specific implementations in the sigma-rust and sigmastate-interpreter projects. The ErgoScript compiler takes high-level ErgoScript code and translates it into an intermediate form that can be evaluated by the ErgoTree interpreter or serialized for execution in the Ergo blockchain.\n\nThe compiler pipeline includes the following phases: Lexical Analysis (Lexer), Syntax Analysis (Parser), High-level Intermediate Representation (HIR), Binding (Binder), and Type Inference. Each phase is described in detail, including how it works, error handling, and the specific implementations in the sigma-rust and sigmastate-interpreter projects.",

    {
      "question": "What are the key phases in the ErgoScript compiler pipeline?",
      "answer": "The key phases in the ErgoScript compiler pipeline are: 1) Source Code, 2) Parse, 3) Bind, 4) Typecheck, 5) BuildGraph, and 6) BuildTree."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Lexer (Lexical Analysis) phase in the ErgoScript compiler?",
      "answer": "The purpose of the Lexer (Lexical Analysis) phase is to scan the source code and convert it into a sequence of tokens, which are the smallest meaningful elements in the code, such as keywords, operators, literals, and identifiers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the Lexer implemented in the `sigma-rust` and `sigmastate-interpreter` projects?",
      "answer": "In `sigma-rust`, the Lexer is implemented using the `Logos` crate, which provides an efficient way to define lexing rules in Rust. In `sigmastate-interpreter`, a custom Scala-based Lexer is used for tokenization."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Parser (Syntax Analysis) phase in the ErgoScript compiler?",
      "answer": "The purpose of the Parser (Syntax Analysis) phase is to take the list of tokens generated by the Lexer and construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which represents the syntactical structure of the source code in a tree format."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are the Parser and AST implemented in the `sigma-rust` and `sigmastate-interpreter` projects?",
      "answer": "In `sigma-rust`, the parser uses the `Rowan` library to manage Concrete Syntax Trees (CST) and Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), where AST nodes wrap Rowan's trees and expose node-specific details. In `sigmastate-interpreter`, the Scala implementation utilizes its own parsing strategies to construct the AST from tokens."

Tokens are the smallest meaningful elements in the code, such as keywords, operators, literals, and identifiers.\n\n- **How it works**: The Lexer reads the input source code character by character and groups characters into tokens. These tokens are categorized and labeled for the parser to consume.\n    - **Example**: Keywords like `if`, `else`, or operators like `+`, `-` are converted into tokens representing these elements in the language.\n\n- **In `sigma-rust`**: Implemented using the `Logos` crate, which provides an efficient way to define lexing rules in Rust.\n    - **Location**: [`ergoscript-compiler/src/lexer.rs`](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/blob/develop/ergoscript-compiler/src/lexer.rs)\n\n- **In `sigmastate-interpreter`**: A custom Scala-based Lexer is used for tokenization.\n    - **Location**: [`parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/Lexer.scala`](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/parsers/shared/src/main/scala/sigmastate/lang/Lexer.scala)"

      "content": "**Objective**: The Parser takes the list of tokens generated by the Lexer and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST represents the syntactical structure of the source code in a tree format, where each node corresponds to a language construct like an expression, statement, or function.\n\n- **How it works**: The parser traverses the tokens in a predefined grammatical order to build the AST. This process involves ensuring that the source code follows the language's syntax rules. In Sigma, this is done via the `SigmaCompiler.parse` method.\n    - **Example**: An expression like `a + b` would be represented as a node in the AST with `+` as the root and `a` and `b` as its children.\n\n    - **Error Handling**: Any parsing errors throw a `ParserException`.\n\n- **In `sigma-rust`**: The parser uses the `Rowan` library to manage Concrete Syntax Trees (CST) and Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).

      "content": "**Objective**: The HIR simplifies the AST by abstracting away certain syntactical details while retaining the logical structure of the code. This intermediate representation is more conducive to further analysis and transformation.\n\n- **How it works**: The AST is transformed into HIR by \"lowering\" its structure, which means simplifying and standardizing the representation while retaining all necessary information for the subsequent compilation phases.\n    - **Example**: Complex language constructs in the AST are reduced to simpler, more uniform representations in the HIR.\n\n- **In `sigma-rust`**: Each HIR node has a kind (enum), span (source code reference), and an optional type. This makes it easier to perform operations like type inference and binding.\n    - **Location**: [`ergoscript-compiler/src/hir.rs`](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/blob/develop/ergoscript-compiler/src/hir.rs)\n\n- **In `sigmastate-interpreter`**: HIR serves a similar purpose, with emphasis on compatibility with the Scala language's functional programming features.\n    - **Location**: [`sc/shared/src/main/scala/sigma/compiler/ir/TypeDescs.scala`](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/sc/shared/src/main/scala/sigma/compiler/ir/TypeDescs.scala)"

This includes resolving variables, functions, and constants to ensure that the script's logic is correctly mapped to the underlying data structures.\n\n- **How it works**: The Binder, implemented in `SigmaBinder.bind`, traverses the HIR and replaces symbolic names with actual references. This process involves checking the environment (like global variables and predefined constants) and linking them appropriately. It also transforms environment values of predefined Scala types (such as `Int`, `Boolean`, `Box`, etc.) into constant nodes (`IntConstant`, `BoxConstant`, etc.) of the corresponding type.\n    - **Example**: An identifier like `HEIGHT` in a script would be resolved to the actual block height from the environment.\n\n    - **Error Handling**: Any binding errors throw a `BinderException`.\n\n- **In `sigma-rust`**: The Binder rewrites the HIR tree, swapping identifiers (e.g., `HEIGHT`), some predefined functions (e.g., `min/max`), and variables from the environment (`ScriptEnv`) with their HIR nodes, ensuring correct references.\n    - **Location**: [`ergoscript-compiler/src/binder.rs`](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/blob/develop/ergoscript-compiler/src/binder.rs)\n\n- **In `sigmastate-interpreter`**: A similar process is implemented in Scala, using the Scala language's features for name resolution and binding.\n    - **Location**: [`sc/shared/src/main/scala/sigma/compiler/phases/SigmaBinder.scala`](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/sc/shared/src/main/scala/sigma/compiler/phases/SigmaBinder.scala)"

      "content": "**Objective**: Type Inference ensures that all expressions in the script are type-safe by determining the types of all expressions. This phase is crucial for ensuring that all operations in the script are performed on compatible types.\n\n- **How it works**: The Type Inference algorithm recursively analyzes the HIR and assigns types to each expression. It checks for type consistency and infers types where they are not explicitly provided. The type assignment is performed by the `assignType` tree transformation, which assigns correct types to all tree nodes.\n    - **Example**: In a script, if an integer is added to a floating-point number, type inference will ensure that the operation is valid and determine the result's type.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Any type inference errors throw a `TyperException`.\n\n- **In `sigma-rust`**: Type inference is implemented as a separate phase that traverses the HIR tree and assigns types, ensuring type correctness before moving to the next phase.\n    - **Location**: [`ergoscript-compiler/src/type_infer.rs`](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/blob/develop/ergoscript-compiler/src/type_infer.rs)\n\n- **In `sigmastate-interpreter`**: Type inference follows Scala's type system rules, ensuring that all expressions are type-safe.\n    - **Location**: [`sc/shared/src/main/scala/sigma/compiler/phases/SigmaTyper.scala`](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/sc/shared/src/main/scala/sigma/compiler/phases/SigmaTyper.scala)"

This graph representation allows for optimizations such as constant propagation, common subexpression elimination, and dead code elimination.\n\n- **How it works**: The `IRContext.buildGraph` method takes the typed AST and builds the graph. During graph building, the following optimizations are performed:\n  - **Constant Propagation**: Replaces variables with their known constant values.\n  - **Common Subexpression Elimination**: Identifies and eliminates redundant computations.\n  - **Dead Code Elimination**: Removes code that does not affect the final output.\n\n- **In `sigma-rust`**: The MIR generated during this phase is the final form of the intermediate representation used by the interpreter and for serialization.\n    - **Location**: [`ergotree-ir/src/mir.rs`](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust/blob/develop/ergotree-ir/src/mir.rs)\n\n- **In `sigmastate-interpreter`**: The graph building phase focuses on preparing the code for efficient execution by the ErgoTree interpreter.\n    - **Location**: [`sc/shared/src/main/scala/sigma/compiler/ir/ProgramGraphs.scala`](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/blob/develop/sc/shared/src/main/scala/sigma/compiler/ir/ProgramGraphs.scala)"
