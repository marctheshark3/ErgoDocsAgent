  "summary": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital artworks represented on blockchains through immutable smart contracts. They can be traded on decentralized auction platforms, democratizing art markets. Existing platforms like Rarible and Opensea operate on the Ethereum network, but have high gas fees for minting NFTs. Ergo's blockchain offers a more scalable and efficient design to reduce these costs. Several Ergo-based platforms provide NFT marketplace capabilities, including ErgoAuctions, SkyHarbor, and Mew Finance, which offers features like revenue sharing and fee-free transactions for higher-tier members.",

These artworks are represented as [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) (NFTs).
