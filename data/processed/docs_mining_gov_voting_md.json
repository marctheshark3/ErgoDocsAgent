  "title": "Voting Cycles and Types of Changes",
  "summary": "The document discusses the voting cycles and types of changes in a blockchain system. Foundational changes, such as block version, require a 90% miner consensus and span 32 epochs, while everyday changes, like block size adjustments, require only a simple majority. Miners can cast votes for up to two everyday changes and one foundational change per block. The voting mechanics, system constants, current network settings, and a parameters table are provided. The document also explains how miners can propose and vote for changes by including the vote identifier in the block header.",
