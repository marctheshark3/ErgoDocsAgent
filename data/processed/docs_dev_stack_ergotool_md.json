In the directory where we cloned ErgoTool, there is the `ergo-tool.sh` script we will use to run commands. Run the following command to check that ErgoTool is installed correctly.\n\n```bash\n$ ./ergo-tool.sh help     \nthe command name is not specified (run ergo-tool without arguments to list commands)\n\nCommand Name: help\nUsage Syntax: ergo-tool help <commandName>\nDescription:  prints usage help for a command\nDoc page: https://aslesarenko.github.io/ergo-tool/api/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ergotool/HelpCmd.html\n```\n\nLet's see what we get here. ErgoTool outputs the error message with the information about the `help` command. This is a typical output of ErgoTool when one of the known commands is specified but used incorrectly. As we can learn from the message, the `help.` the command requires us to specify an additional `<commandName>` argument. Also, each command has an API doc page with all the details about command execution, so its URL is shown here."

For random convenience sequence of English words is used, but this is not required. Run the following command to generate a new mnemonic phrase:\n\n```bash\n$ ./ergo-tool.sh mnemonic          \nbird harbor wheat innocent business disease busy quick yellow trust time oil enter situate moon\n```\n\nPlease write it down on paper and keep it in a safe and secret place. As an additional security measure, you can create a random mnemonic password. In some sense, it can serve as another non-vocabulary word in the mnemonic. A mnemonic password is optional and is used for additional security. If you decide to use a mnemonic password, you should also write it down and keep it a secret, probably different from a mnemonic one.\n\n**Important, both mnemonic phrases and mnemonic passwords are required to restore secret keys, if you lose any of them, then you will not be able to regenerate your master key again.**\n\nNext, use the generated Mnemonic to create storage with a master secret key."

The Mnemonic itself is not stored in the file, and there is no way to restore it from the file, even if you know the passwords.\n \nPlease enter the correct mnemonic password, the one you chose and saved before.\n\nSince a mnemonic password is optional, you can leave it empty by pressing enter.\n\nIf you forget the storage password (aka encryption password), you will not be able to use that storage file anymore; however, you can always restore your secret keys from (Mnemonic the phrase, mnemonic password) pair and thus create a new storage file with a new password.\n\nKeep your storage file and storage password in secret; anyone who obtains both your storage file and storage password will be able to decipher it and access secret keys."
