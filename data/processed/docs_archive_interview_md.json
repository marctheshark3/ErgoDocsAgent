      "question": "Is there a plan to create a Plutus Pioneer-style program for ErgoScript?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Ergo Foundation can sponsor the money for educational programs, which is one of the core goals of the Ergo Foundation as an organization."

      "question": "How does the Ergo network plan to fund development over time?",
      "answer": "Longer-term, a community development DAO is proposed to operate in parallel to the Ergo Foundation, potentially funded through projects that tokenize on the Ergo Blockchain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the Ergo network encourage competition for dApps?",
      "answer": "Yes, the Ergo network actively encourages competing dApps, as competition is a critical part of creating a DEFI environment."

      "question": "What are some of the unique challenges in building on the Ergo network compared to other blockchain platforms?",
      "answer": "Much of the infrastructure has to be created from scratch to match Ergo's Extended UTXO model, which is a bi-product of leading the Extended UTXO model to market."

      "question": "Who are the current primary users of the Ergo network and what are the plans to capture additional markets?",
      "answer": "The primary users of Ergo are currently either investors or miners, but the focus is to create the basic tooling to support demand on top of the base layer and capture multiple markets."

      "content": "Longer-term, we propose a community development DAO that operates in parallel to the Ergo Foundation. One potential mechanism to fund this would be through projects that tokenize on the Ergo Blockchain. Open source development often comes with a variety of assistance from the community. \n\nIf new projects are willing to donate a small allocation of their tokens to either the Ergo Foundation or a community DAO, it opens a long-term funding path.  \n\nWe have already started discussions with projects."

      "level": 4,
      "content": "We actively encourage competing dapps. Competition is a critical part of creating a DEFI environment. It opens the ability for traders to arbitrage across dapps and creates increased activity on the network. Competing marketplaces also increases market efficiency. We encourage competition. It creates market opportunities and incentives to innovate."

      "content": "Free software is amazing. Bitcoin would not exist without free software. Much of the internet would not exist without Linux. Ergo is a new contract model. Most projects are based on EVM or previous forks.\n\nMuch of the infrastructure has to be created from scratch to match Ergo's model. Is that a negative? No, it is a bi-product of leading the Extended UTXO model to market.  \n\nSo far, we have produced the first extended UTXO dapp, stablecoin, oracle framework, NFT, and dex. Currently, there is ongoing R&D into multiple L2 solutions. Ergo will most likely start with plasma channels first and expand to models with more complexity. We are also in the development process of bridging to other ecosystems. Additionally, a framework for sidechains has come out of our R&D group and will be implemented in 2022."

      "content": "Ergo is still a very young network. At this point, the primary users are either investors or miners. However, as we build tooling, we have a path to capture multiple markets. Ergo is not a native token. It is a base layer blockchain; the focus is to create the basic tooling to support demand on top of the base layer. \n\nUnique needs arise when analyzing different projects. We are already putting together multiple Ergo Improvement Protocols to support development. \n\nMarket specialization is the focus of developers and projects on top of Ergo. Our goal is to build a variety of tooling and infrastructure to support this growth."

      "content": "Ergo's advantages are beyond the benefits of Extended UTXO; we have a lot of interesting privacy options with Sigma protocols; Ergo also has a simple path to sidechains and a way to revolutionize SPV client implementation. Ultralite SPV clients via NIPoPoWs with full node security have never been implemented. \n\nErgo is pushing the boundaries of Proof of Work and Extended UTXO simultaneously. We plan to continue the research first approach and push the boundaries of what POW is capable of. \n\nI would say there are two disadvantages. The first is time. There is considerable mindshare developed around EVM, and the account model in this comparison, Extended UTXO, is behind. \n\nThe second is the current market mindset does care about first principles or crypto or the actual resilience of distributed systems. However, we do believe that both of these will change in time. \n\nReal decentralization, privacy, and resilience are not attractive when you don't need them. \n\nThis type of network does come with a tradeoff vs systems designed to be more centralized, permissioned, and optimized. The value of resilience only matters in difficult environments."

      "heading": "I would be interested in some real critique rather than nonsense FUD about PoW not being environmentally friendly.",
      "level": 4,
      "content": "POW is energy-intensive relative to POS. However, the security model is known. The design of Ergo is pretty conservative. We chose Sigma protocols because they are well known. They have been studied and tested in-depth for a long time. \n\nThere are newer, fancier cryptographic frameworks. However, they have not been rigorously tested to the point where the assumptions can be considered truly sound. If the assumptions break, the cryptography breaks as well. Ergo is also designed to be amendable, meaning it can be upgraded in time. If newer cryptography demonstrates resilience, we can always add it in the future. \n\nPoW is seen as a store of value based on the energy used to back the production of the digital asset. The best way to encourage ERG as a store of value is to use well-researched methods and cryptography. \n\nProof of Stake is not bad; we are happy to work with Proof of Stake chains. \n\nOne of the largest short-term liabilities in POS tokens is that they resemble security much more than a fair launched POW token.  \n\nThere are areas in POS where the security models are not known as they have not been fully implemented.\n\nThe reality with POS is each particular network has to create security assumptions based on various factors unique to each project. \n \nIn terms of usability, consensus, etc., there are a lot of unique challenges in Proof of Stake.  \n\nIf POS projects support stake migration, how will that alter network congestion, TLV in DEFI, and rates of return in DEFI? \n\nThere are a lot of factors that are hard to predict. Ergo is not anti-proof of stake. However, there are many unknowns and complexities in the project."

Financial ammunition sounds like a really sexy way to say how large of a position is not public. This did not happen with Ergo. Why? To promote decentralization.\nPersonally, I think that partnering with larger firms or investors makes sense after a significant period of being on the market (as with bitcoin) rather than an insider advantage from launch."

Ergo has the capacity to increase throughput with L2 solutions and sidechains. But it will never be as fast as a centralized system.\nThe closer a system gets to centralization or as the user requirements increase, the faster it gets."

But trust us\u2026\nYou can't replicate it locally but trust us\u2026\nErgo is trustless and open. I cannot police projects in an open network, but I can encourage developers to recognize the benefits. It is better to provide metrics that can be replicated. It is better to provide transparency. I could use the example here of Uniswap V3.\nHad they open-sourced this framework, it would have evolved. Open source accelerates frameworks, becoming more efficient for users and most likely more profitable.\n\nhttps://cointelegraph.com/news/half-of-uniswap-v3-liquidity-providers-are-losing-money-new-research\nThere are also serious security concerns from closed projects as the community review process does not occur. A lack of community review could potentially lead to catastrophic hacks.\nhttps://ambcrypto.com/now-fixed-solana-protocol-library-bug-had-potential-to-expose-2-6-billion-to-risk-of-theft/\nThe goal of the Ergo network is the benefit the users.
