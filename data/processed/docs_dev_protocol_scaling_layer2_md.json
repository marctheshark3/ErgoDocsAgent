  "summary": "Layer 2 solutions are secondary frameworks or protocols constructed on top of a Layer 1 blockchain protocol to enhance efficiency, scalability, and capabilities. Ergo is compatible with various Layer 2 solutions like Hydra and sidechains, which help alleviate blockchain congestion and offer benefits akin to ZK-rollups. ErgoScript's flexible design allows large parts of transactions to be executed on Layer 2, which are then settled on the Ergo blockchain. Current Layer 2 projects and developments include solutions leveraging sub-blocks, SigmaChains and sidechains, ChainCash, and Plasma for data structures. Ergo also utilizes NIPoPoWs to enhance blockchain interoperability and scalability.",
