  "summary": "The Ergo Data Model document provides an in-depth exploration of Ergo's unique data model, which is based on the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model and enhanced with smart contract capabilities (eUTXO). The document covers the theoretical foundations and core concepts, including the evolution of computational models, the advantages of Ergo's eUTXO model over the account-based model, and the fundamental design principles of computational completeness, cryptographic composability, and scalable state management.\n\nThe document then delves into the blockchain structure, describing the components and functions of Ergo blocks, including the block header, transactions, AD Proofs, and the extension section. It then focuses on the foundational state units called \"Boxes,\" which are Ergo's implementation of the UTXO concept, enhanced with features like immutable state, typed registers, and programmable spending conditions.\n\nFinally, the document explores transactions, which are the engines of state change in Ergo, defining how boxes are created, transformed, and consumed.",

      "content": "A [Box](box.md) is essentially a \"smart UTXO\" - it serves the same role as a UTXO in tracking unspent value, but extends this with sophisticated computational features. Like a UTXO, a Box is created when value is sent in a [transaction](transactions.md) and is consumed (spent) when that value is transferred elsewhere. However, Boxes add the following capabilities that go beyond basic UTXOs:\n\n* **Immutable State**: Each box represents an atomic, immutable state unit that cannot be modified after creation. *(Lifecycle details might be added later or linked if a dedicated page exists)*.\n\n* **Typed Registers**: Boxes contain 10 [registers](registers.md) (R0-R9) with specific purposes and rich computational potential:\n    * R0: Monetary Value (in nanoERGs)\n    * R1: Protection Script ([Smart Contract](ergoscript.md))\n    * R2: Assets/[Tokens](eip4.md)\n    * R3: Creation Details\n    * R4-R9: Flexible, Typed Custom Data Storage\n        - Supports multiple data types: `Int`, `Long`, `BigInt`, `GroupElement`, `Coll[Byte]`\n        - Can store complex structures and collections\n        - Densely packed with type-safe access\n\n* **Programmable Spending Conditions**: Each box specifies precise conditions under which it can be spent, enabling complex logic through [ErgoScript](ergoscript.md). See [Box Modeling](box_modeling.md) and [Box Overview](box.md) for detailed exploration.\n\nBy transforming UTXOs from simple value trackers to programmable state containers, Ergo enables more expressive and flexible blockchain interactions while maintaining cryptographic integrity and computational efficiency.\n\n\n\n---"
