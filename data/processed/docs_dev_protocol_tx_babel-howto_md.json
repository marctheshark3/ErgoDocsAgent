  "summary": "The document discusses the problem of blockchain transaction fees and how Babel fees on the Ergo blockchain provide a solution. Babel fees allow users to pay for transactions using native tokens instead of the blockchain's native coin ($ERG). The process of providing Babel fee liquidity is outlined, and the benefits of using Babel fees, such as increased transaction efficiency and flexibility, are highlighted.",

    {
      "question": "What is the problem that Babel fees aim to solve on the Ergo blockchain?",
      "answer": "The problem is that every transaction on the Ergo blockchain requires a payment in $ERG, which can create complexities for users who want to hold assets other than $ERG, such as native tokens or NFTs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Babel fees work on the Ergo blockchain?",
      "answer": "Babel fees allow users to pay for transactions using fungible, native tokens that have liquidity, rather than having to use $ERG. This is achieved by users providing liquidity on the blockchain by agreeing to buy the native asset for $ERG at a specified rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the steps to provide Babel fee liquidity on the Ergo blockchain?",
      "answer": "The steps to provide Babel fee liquidity include: visiting the Tokenjay site, connecting an ErgoPay wallet, selecting a token, entering a rate and amount of $ERG, and creating a Babel fee box."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do users utilize the Babel fee bank boxes on the Ergo blockchain?",
      "answer": "Users can utilize the Babel fee bank boxes by selecting a native token to pay the transaction fee in their wallet, such as Nautilus, and the wallet will automatically select the best rate from the available Babel fee bank boxes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key benefits of Babel fees on the Ergo blockchain?",
      "answer": "The key benefits of Babel fees on the Ergo blockchain are that they eliminate the need for users to hold $ERG in each wallet they own, and they make the blockchain more fluid and flexible by increasing the efficiency of transactions and interactions on the network."

      "content": "Every blockchain requires a fee to fund transactions, and it is most often a blockchain's respective coin that pays for transactions on the network. In the case of Ergo, every transaction requires a payment in $ERG.\n\nFor those who are active within a blockchain\u2019s ecosystem, there is often a desire to hold assets other than that blockchain\u2019s coin. You may want to buy NFTs, or you may want other tokens native to the blockchain. Depending on a wallet's holdings, the need to use $ERG to pay for transactions may create some complexities. What if the wallet does not have enough $ERG to fund a transaction where the user is trying to send a native token? This sort of scenario might discourage a person from using the chain because they cannot fund a transaction with $ERG.  \n\nBased on the above scenario, it would be more convenient to pay for transactions in native tokens rather than $ERG. This is now possible with the introduction of Babel fees."

      "content": "Before using Babel fees, someone (or many people) must provide liquidity on the blockchain. They agree to buy the native asset for $ERG at some rate. To illustrate: \n\n1. Go to the [Tokenjay](https://tokenjay.app/) site.\n2. Click \u201cOpen App\u201d. \n3. Click \u201cPurchase Tokens\u201d.\n4. Click \u201cBabel Fee Liquidity\u201d.\n5. Connect a compatible ErgoPay wallet.\n6. Click \u201ccreate new babel fee box\u201d.\n7. Select token from drop-down box or own ID entered below.\n8. Optional: Enter token ID of a fungible token (not an NFT) not on drop-down list.\n9. Enter rate, or number of $ERG per token, often as a decimal, such as 0.0001.\n10. Enter the amount of $ERG you are willing to buy at that rate.\n11. Click \u201ccreate Babel fee box\u201d.\n12. Scan QR code.\n13. Check the rates before signing.\n14. Optional: Go back to Step 6 if the rates were not as expected.\n15. Sign transaction in your ErgoPay compatible wallet.\n\n![babel-liquidity (1).png](https://storage.googleapis.com/ergo-cms-media/babel_liquidity_1_adbeccffe1/babel_liquidity_1_adbeccffe1.png)\n\nThis provides a Babel Fee bank box, which anyone can use to trade the digital asset for $ERG to pay for transactions. Building the transaction is handled within a wallet that supports Babel Fees."

      "heading": "Using Babel Fee Bank Boxes",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "Using Babel Fee Boxes is simple. Nautilus, for example, allows you to pick a token to pay a fee based on what is in your wallet, and it selects the best rate from the Babel Fee bank boxes available on the blockchain. In the case below, the token SigUSD is being used to swap for the necessary amount of $ERG to pay for the transaction. The process of choosing to pay with Babel fees is as simple as selecting the native asset from a pull-down list. \n\n![babel-nautilius (1).png](https://storage.googleapis.com/ergo-cms-media/babel_nautilius_1_0203d2c22a/babel_nautilius_1_0203d2c22a.png)"

      "level": 4,
      "content": "Babel Fees are an innovative solution that make blockchains easier to use. For users, they eliminate the need to keep the blockchain coin in each wallet they own. It basically helps to prevent assets from getting \u201cstuck\u201d because a wallet does not have the blockchain\u2019s coin (or enough of that coin). The introduction of Babel fees on Ergo offers a significant boost to the versatility of the blockchain. With this newly implemented technology, Ergo becomes much more fluid and flexible by increasing the efficiency of transactions and interactions on the network."
