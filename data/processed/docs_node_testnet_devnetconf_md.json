  "summary": "This document describes the configuration settings for the Ergo node in the Development Network (devnet). It covers the main sections and fields of the configuration file, including network type, chain configuration, wallet configuration, and Scorex configuration. The network type is set to \"devnet\" for development purposes. The chain configuration includes parameters such as protocol version, address prefix, initial difficulty, and voting mechanisms. The wallet configuration sets the directory for the wallet's secret storage. The Scorex configuration covers network settings like magic bytes, bind address, node name, and known peers, as well as the REST API configuration for the API key hash.",

A value of 1 means difficulty is recalculated every block.\n- `blockInterval` is the desired time interval between blocks.\n- `monetary.minerRewardDelay` sets the delay between when a block is mined and when the reward can be spent.\n- `voting` contains parameters related to the voting mechanism, such as the length of a voting epoch, the number of epochs for soft-fork voting, and activation epochs for a soft-fork after acceptance.\n- `genesisStateDigestHex` is the Base16 representation of the genesis state roothash."
