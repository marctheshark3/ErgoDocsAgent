      "level": 3,
      "content": "Introducing changes to Merkle Tree-related components or their semantics must be approached cautiously. Versioning and compatibility with existing applications and contracts are critical to ensuring a smooth transition and minimizing disruptions across the ecosystem. Developers must carefully plan and communicate any updates to the ErgoTree version or changes in operations (e.g., BigInt semantics) to ensure all components, including wallets and scanners, are updated accordingly."
