  "summary": "The Rosen Bridge is designed to bootstrap liquidity across multiple ecosystems. The Rosen Token (RSN) serves as a sybil resistance mechanism, a fee distribution mechanism, and a means to access Rosen Bridge services. Watchers and Guards are required to stake RSN and ERG as collateral to participate in the system, and they can earn rewards for their services. The total RSN supply is 1,000,000,000, with 10% allocated for initial liquidity bootstrapping, 38.5% for future liquidity bootstrapping, 25% for event-based emission rewards, 2.5% for passive staking, 10.5% for the team budget, 10.5% for the treasury, and 3% for the Ergo Foundation. Rosen Bridge is self-funded with no private sales, venture capital, or SAFT agreements involved. The initial liquidity for Ergo was deposited on the Spectrum LP, and the project has received funding from Catalyst and the F10 program. The RSN token is needed for capital formation and to create incentives for the Rosen Bridge ecosystem.",

      "question": "Why is the RSN token needed?",

The Rosen Token serves the as a sybil resistance mechanism for the Rosen framework, a fee distribution mechanism, and means to access services of the Rosen Bridge.\n\n[Watchers](watcher.md) are required to put collateral in RSN and ERG by staking, which allows them to acquire reporting permits. Guards need to lock RSN as collateral. Funds will be emitted to the Guard Set and involved Watchers in case of any successful bridge transfers. However, funds will be slashed/collected in case of malicious behavior. When RSN emission has ended, all bridge fees will be collected in the RSN token. Holding RSN will have special fee benefits for projects.\n\nAny user can join as a Watcher given they meet the collateral requirements needed to participate, and earn rewards for their services."
