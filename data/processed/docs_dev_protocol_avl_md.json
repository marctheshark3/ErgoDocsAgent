  "title": "AVL Trees in Ergo: An Overview",
  "summary": "The document provides an overview of AVL trees, a type of authenticated data structure, and their integration with the Ergo blockchain. AVL trees offer advantages such as the ability to authenticate data properties without accessing the entire dataset. Ergo utilizes AVL trees to enhance the security and efficiency of its applications. Developers can integrate AVL trees into their Ergo projects using the GetBlok Plasma library, which provides an abstraction layer for incorporating AVL trees as a Layer-2 scaling solution. The document highlights the efficiency and proof size of AVL trees, as well as their superior performance in validation and verification processes, which contribute to the overall performance and scalability of Ergo applications.",
