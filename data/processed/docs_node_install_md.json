    },
    {
      "question": "What are the minimum hardware requirements for running an Ergo node?",
      "answer": "The minimum hardware requirements are approximately ~20GB of storage for the blockchain and ~8GB of RAM for handling the initial sync. We recommend having at least 4-6GB of RAM available for the node process and using a fast SSD."
    },
    {
      "question": "What version of Java is required to run an Ergo node?",
      "answer": "An Ergo node requires a JDK/JRE version >= 9 installed on your system. We recommend using Oracle Java SE or SDKMAN for Unix-based systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the alternatives to running a full Ergo node?",
      "answer": "If you're simply looking for a secure place to store your ERG, see the wallets page. Some wallets like Satergo offer an integrated option to install and run a full node."

Running a node is crucial for the network's decentralization and security. This page outlines the installation options and resources for the Ergo reference client.\n\n\n/// details | Alternatives\n    {type: info, open: true}\nIf you're simply looking for a secure place to store your ERG, see the [wallets](wallets.md) page. Some wallets like [Satergo](satergo.md) offer an integrated option to install and run a full node.\n///\n\n///// details | Installing the Ergo Reference Client\n    {type: tip, open: true}\n//// details | Minimum Requirements & Pre-requisites\n    {type: warning, open: false}\n**Java**\n\nAn Ergo node requires a **JDK/JRE version >= 9** installed on your system. We recommend using [Oracle Java SE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) or SDKMAN for Unix-based systems:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s \"https://get.sdkman.io\" | bash\nsdk install java 11.0.13.8.1-amzn\n```\n\n**Hardware**\n\nThe minimum hardware requirements are approximately ~20GB of storage for the blockchain and ~8GB of RAM for handling the initial sync. Due to potentially intensive disk I/O during sync, we recommend having at least 4-6GB of RAM available for the node process and using a fast SSD. Running with the `-Xmx4G` flag on the JVM is advised.\n////\n//// details | Modes of operation\n    {type: notes, open: true}\nErgo node offers various [Modes of Operation](modes.md) for user flexibility. For quick sync and full node security, consider setting up a Pruned Full Node.\n/// details | Full Archival Node\n    {type: tip, open: false}\nThis mode stores the entire blockchain history. To install from scratch, refer to the [manual install](manual.md) page for detailed instructions.\n///\n/// details | Pruned Full Node\n    {type: tip, open: false}\nBootstrap a [pruned full node](pruned-full-node.md) using a verified [UTXO set snapshot](eutxo.md) and [NiPoPoWs](nipopows.md). This feature allows you to achieve full node security on standard hardware within minutes, eliminating the need to download and validate most of the historical blockchain data.\n///\n/// details | Light Full Node\n    {type: tip, open: false}\n[This mode](light-full-node.md) only holds the root digest of the state dictionary and checks full blocks or a suffix of the blockchain, depending on the `blocksToKeep` setting ([History Pruning](history-pruning.md)).\n///\n////\n\n//// details | Per device\n    {type: notes, open: true}\n/// details | Android\n    {type: tip, open: false}\nSync the entire Ergo blockchain on your [mobile device](node-android.md)!\n///\n/// details | Raspberri Pi\n    {type: tip, open: false}\nRun a node on a [Raspberry Pi](pi.md)!\n///\n////\n\n\n//// details | Developer Resources\n    {type: notes, open: false}\n\n/// details | DeepWiki Documentation\n    {type: info, open: true}\nFor an alternative and potentially more detailed documentation source generated from the repository, explore the [Ergo Node on DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/ergoplatform/ergo/1-ergo-node-overview)\n///\n\n\n/// details | Get setup on Testnet\n    {type: tip, open: false}\nAlternatively, if you want to get started on the [testnet](testnet.md), there is a dedicated [testnet setup guide](testnet.md) available.\n///\n/// details | Use Docker\n    {type: tip, open: false}\nFor more convenience, Docker provides a streamlined way to install and run the Ergo Node.
