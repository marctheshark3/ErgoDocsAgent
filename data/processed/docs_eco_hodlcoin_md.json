  "title": "Hodlcoin: A High-Risk, High-Reward Game",
  "summary": "Hodlcoin is a high-risk, high-reward game that encourages players to \"HODL\" their ERGs. Players can deposit ERGs into a common reserve or withdraw by burning their HODL ERGs, with un-HODLing incurring a penalty fee that is added to the reserve. The idea for Hodlcoin dates back to 2020 and was revisited in 2022, with a collaboration between developers leading to its rapid progression. However, a security vulnerability was discovered that allowed the bank box to be drained, prompting the development of a second version by community developers. The relaunched Hodlcoin now operates with two frontends using the same bank. The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the risks and managing them when participating in experimental decentralized finance.",

      "question": "How does the Hodlcoin game work?",
      "answer": "Players can deposit their ERGs into a common reserve (HODLing) or withdraw ERGs from the reserve by burning their HODL ERGs (un-HODLing). Un-HODLing incurs a penalty fee that is added to the common reserve."

      "question": "What was the security incident that occurred with Hodlcoin?",
      "answer": "A vulnerability was introduced during the development process that allowed the bank box to be drained. Krasavice Blasen identified the error and drained the funds to prevent a malicious actor from doing so."

      "content": "Hodlcoin, a high-risk, high-reward game, was originally a concept conceived by one of the designers of Djed (SigmaUSD). The game encourages players to \"HODL\" their ERGs. The rules are straightforward: players can deposit their ERGs into a common reserve (HODLing) or withdraw ERGs from the reserve by burning their HODL ERGs (un-HODLing). While there are no fees for HODLing, un-HODLing incurs a penalty fee (e.g., 3% or 10%) that is added to the common reserve. This structure creates an incentive for players to hold their ERGs for longer periods, as they benefit from the fees paid by those who un-HODL.\n\nFront-end interfaces available at [Hodlcoin](https://app.hodlcoin.co.in/) and [PhoenixFi](https://phoenixfi.app/)."

      "content": "The idea for Hodlcoin dates back to 2020 when the goal was to simplify the design of Djed/SigmaUSD and create a stablecoin protocol that wouldn't require a reserve coin or an oracle. Although initially dismissed as a wild idea (especially if the goal was to create a stablecoin, given that the price of hodlERG only increases), the concept was revisited in 2022 and shared with @kushti_ru. By Spring of 2023, it was agreed that Hodlcoin could be an intriguing DegenFi product. The collaboration with @pulsarzz began shortly after, and the rapid progression of the project is a testament to Ergo's capacity for innovation."
