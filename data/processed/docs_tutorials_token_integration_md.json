  "summary": "This guide outlines the process for integrating and listing tokens that have been bridged between networks using Rosen Bridge. It covers the cross-chain possibilities, key considerations for multi-chain presence, and the steps for initial listing and market data setup on platforms like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, LiveCoinWatch, and GeckoTerminal. The guide aims to help ensure proper integration of tokens across different ecosystems connected via the Rosen Bridge.",
