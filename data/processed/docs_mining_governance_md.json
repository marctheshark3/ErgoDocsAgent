  "summary": "Ergo's governance model is designed to facilitate network upgrades and parameter adjustments through a decentralized voting mechanism among miners. This approach ensures the long-term economic stability and adaptability of the Ergo network. Ergo implements measures to prevent disruptive hard forks, such as pushing complexity to the application layer and enabling many features to be implemented via soft-forks. Miners can vote to change specific protocol parameters, with soft-forking changes requiring 90% miner support. The detailed information on the voting process, including voting mechanics, system constants, and how to propose and vote for changes, is available on the dedicated Voting page.",
