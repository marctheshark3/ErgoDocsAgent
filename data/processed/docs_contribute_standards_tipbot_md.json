Once the wallet is created, send a pm with `!address` to show your tip address.\n3. Copy your tip address and open your Yoroi wallet.\n4. Click the send tab and transfer some ERG's to the tip wallet address. (Any transaction requires at least 0.001 erg in fees, on top of that funds in utxo are stored in a box. Each box needs to have a small amount of erg in them. So on the tip bot a token tip will require 0.00115 erg)\n5. If you want to tip a token like Kushti for example, transfer the token to the same tip wallet address. \n6. Once the transactions are sent (~ 2 minutes), send a PM to u/ErgoTipperBot: `!balance`\n7. Your balance should look like this:\n\n| token  | amount |\n|--------|:-------|\n| Erg    | 0.1    |\n| Kushti | 100    |\n\n8. You are good to go! In one of the subreddits where u/ErgoTipperBot is activated write a comment to the person you want to tip with the following command (without the brackets):\n`!tip <amount> <token> <any remaining text will be stored in the transaction database so you can both view it later>`"
