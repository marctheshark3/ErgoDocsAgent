  "title": "Know Your Assumptions (KYA) in Ergo",
  "summary": "The document discusses the \"Know Your Assumptions\" (KYA) model embraced by the Ergo ecosystem, which promotes transparency and user awareness of the assumptions made when interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. It covers the KYA research paper being developed by developer Kushti, the use of KYA prompts in the Ergo ecosystem to inform users of key assumptions, and the specific assumptions underlying the Ergo blockchain, including its security, economic, and scalability features. The document also outlines the key assumptions underpinning Bitcoin's security model.",

      "content": "Ergo introduces **KYA prompts** to inform users of key assumptions before interacting with different protocols. These prompts are designed to provide clear, concise information about the risks, requirements, and assumptions associated with each protocol, enabling users to make informed decisions.\n\nKYA prompts typically cover the following areas:\n\n1. **Security Assumptions**: Highlighting the underlying security mechanisms, such as cryptographic algorithms, consensus models, and trusted parties.\n2. **Economic Assumptions**: Providing details on tokenomics, incentives, and economic factors that affect the protocol's stability and sustainability.\n3. **User Responsibilities**: Outlining what actions users need to take to ensure their safety, such as managing private keys or understanding potential risks in smart contracts.\n4. **External Dependencies**: Identifying any reliance on third-party services or external data, such as oracles, that could impact the protocol's functionality.\n5. **Transparency**: Ensuring that users are aware of any opaque components or centralized elements within a supposedly decentralized protocol.\n\nProjects like **SigmaFi** have adopted KYA prompts, helping users assess critical assumptions and understand the underlying technology. These prompts serve as a valuable tool in empowering users, promoting transparency, and mitigating risks in the DeFi landscape.\n\nFor more, see [Building a standard KYA Prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/ergonauts/comments/159h9rs/building_a_standard_kya_prompt/)."
