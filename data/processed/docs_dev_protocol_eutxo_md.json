  "title": "Extending the Power of the UTXO Model",
  "summary": "The document discusses the Extended UTXO (eUTXO) model used by the Ergo blockchain, which is based on Bitcoin's UTXO model but with enhanced capabilities for building more expressive smart contracts. The key points covered are:\n\nThe UTXO model provides several benefits, including privacy, scalability, interoperability, and predictable transaction costs. Ergo leverages these advantages and extends the UTXO model with eUTXO, which allows smart contracts to use UTXOs as read-only data inputs without modifying them. This enables parallel computation and non-custodial atomic swaps. The eUTXO model also supports Turing-complete smart contracts through a multi-stage UTXO approach. The document provides various resources, including articles, documentation, and videos, for further learning about the eUTXO model.",

      "question": "What is the eUTXO model and how does it differ from the original UTXO model?",

      "question": "What are the key benefits of the UTXO model that Ergo leverages?",
      "answer": "The UTXO model provides benefits such as enhanced privacy, improved scalability, better interoperability, and predictable transaction costs for Ergo."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Ergo's eUTXO model enable Turing-complete smart contracts?",
      "answer": "Ergo's Multi-Stage UTXO model, as detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, allows for the implementation of Turing-complete smart contracts, even though ErgoScript itself is not Turing-complete by design for security reasons."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Ergo's eUTXO model and the Account-Based model used by other platforms?",
      "answer": "In the eUTXO model, nodes primarily verify transactions rather than balances, enabling parallel computation and non-custodial atomic swaps. This differs from the Account-Based model, where nodes need to check all accounts to validate the system."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Ergo's eUTXO model support scalability and interoperability?",
      "answer": "The UTXO model's inherent design supports parallel transaction processing, making it simpler to scale the network. Additionally, UTXOs are more compatible with stateless client solutions like NIPoPoWs and enable seamless integration with off-chain and sidechain protocols."

      "content": "The choice to build upon the UTXO model brings several significant advantages to Ergo:\n\n- **[Privacy](zkp.md)**: UTXOs being one-time objects allow for formalized privacy measures, enhancing user confidentiality.\n- **[Scalability](scaling.md)**: UTXO's inherent design supports parallel transaction processing, making it simpler to scale the network. Additionally, UTXOs are more compatible with stateless client solutions like [NIPoPoWs](nipopows.md).\n- **[Interoperability](use-cases-overview.md#infrastructure)**: UTXOs are well-suited for [off-chain](off-chain.md) and [sidechain](sidechains.md) protocols, enabling seamless integration with various solutions beyond the main chain.\n- **Transaction Cost Predictability**: In Ergo, the on-chain action is primarily focused on validating smart contracts, resulting in significantly lower [transaction costs](min-fee.md). Moreover, the transaction costs are predictable, eliminating the need for gas-like mechanisms found in other platforms.\n\nBy leveraging the advantages of UTXO and extending its capabilities with eUTXO, Ergo provides a powerful and efficient platform for building and executing smart contracts."

In comparison, Ethereum's Account model requires nodes to check all accounts to validate the system.\n\nBy leveraging eUTXO, Ergo enables parallel computation and facilitates non-custodial [atomic swaps](atomic.md). This makes it easier to perform complex operations securely and efficiently.\n\nFurthermore, Ergo's [Multi-Stage UTXO model](multi.md), as detailed in [this peer-reviewed paper](https://fc18.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/bitcoin18-final18.pdf), enables the implementation of *Turing-complete smart contracts.* *(Note: [ErgoScript](ergoscript.md) itself is not Turing-complete by design for security, but the model allows for Turing-complete computations via multi-stage protocols).*\n\nYou can see a comparison between Ergo's eUTXO model and the Account-Based model [here](accountveutxo.md)."
