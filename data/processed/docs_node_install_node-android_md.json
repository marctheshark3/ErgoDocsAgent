  "title": "Running an Ergo Node on Android",
  "summary": "This document provides a guide for running an Ergo node on an Android device using the Termux terminal emulator. It outlines two primary approaches: a simpler \"Digest Mode\" setup and a more advanced \"UTXO Mode\" setup using Arch Linux via proot. The guide covers device requirements, general tips and tricks, and considerations around disk space usage for each method. It recommends the Digest Mode setup for most users and provides an overview of the key steps involved in both approaches.",

      "content": "Meeting these requirements is crucial for a stable experience:\n\n*   **OS:** Android version 7.0 or higher.\n*   **Storage:**\n    *   **Digest Mode:** ~5-10GB free space recommended initially. Actual usage after sync might settle around ~3GB, but bootstrapping can require more temporarily.\n    *   **UTXO Mode (via proot):** Significantly more, potentially 30GB+ depending on pruning (`blocksToKeep`). Archival mode (`blocksToKeep=-1`) is likely impractical on mobile storage.\n*   **RAM:** Minimum 1-2GB available *specifically for Termux/Java*. More RAM (e.g., 4GB+) provides a smoother experience, especially during sync. You will need to use the `-Xmx` Java flag to allocate memory appropriately."

      "content": "*   **Keyboard:** Consider installing a different keyboard app (like Hacker's Keyboard from F-Droid) if your default keyboard doesn't work well in Termux.\n*   **Background Operation:** Install `tmux` (`pkg install tmux` in Termux, or `pacman -S tmux` in the Arch environment) to run the node in a background session that persists even if you close the Termux app window.\n*   **Port Forwarding:** If you want your node to be reachable by external peers, configure port forwarding for TCP port 9030 on your home router to your Android device's local IP address.\n*   **Wallet Connection:** If using the Ergo Wallet App on the same device, you can often change its node setting to `http://127.0.0.1:9053` to connect to your local node.\n*   **Troubleshooting:** If the node fails to start, check common issues:\n    *   Correct Java version installed and selected (`java --version`).\n    *   Sufficient memory allocated via `-Xmx`. Try adjusting the value.\n    *   Correct Ergo node JAR file used (Standard vs. RocksDB variant, depending on the method and `stateType`).\n    *   Syntax errors in your `ergo.conf` file.\n    *   Insufficient free storage space on the device.\n    *   Permissions issues within Termux or the proot environment."
