This approach promotes a gradual and non-disruptive evolution of the Ergo Platform, fostering stability and continuity for the ecosystem.\n\n2. **Open-Source and Permissive Licensing**: The Foundation is committed to maximizing the number of valuable ecosystem developments accomplished in open-source with the least permissive license possible. This philosophy encourages collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation, while minimizing barriers to entry and fostering a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem.\n\n3. **Privacy and Trustless Environments**: The Foundation is dedicated to helping build trustless environments, smart contracts, and payment frameworks for the public with privacy in mind. Ergo's strong focus on privacy and decentralization aligns with the Foundation's mission to empower individuals and promote financial sovereignty.\n\n4. **Community-Driven**: The Foundation believes that the Treasury should be distributed mainly to the community, including freelancers, hackers, experts, and enthusiasts. This approach recognizes the vital role of the community in driving innovation and growth, and aims to cultivate a thriving and self-sustaining ecosystem.\n\n/// details | The Ergo Foundation's Future\n     {type: info, open: true}\nPlease see [this page](ef-future.md) for more information on the long-term goals of The Foundation.\n///"

While its operations in this area are conservative, it does fund a select few roles for areas not currently met by the community, such as:\n\n- Angie Har, Editorial & Events Manager (salaried)\n- Andy Lowe, YouTube Manager (hourly)\n- Sean Rice, Editor (hourly)\n- Eva Qing, Chinese Outreach Manager (hourly)\n- Marcelo Roncatti, Branding Advisor (hourly)\n- Writers (via paid bounties)\n\nTheir efforts ensure ample information is available about ongoing developments on Ergo via blog posts and social media, as well as the promotion and operation of various events, such as Ergo Summit and ErgoHack. These initiatives aim to raise awareness, foster community engagement, and attract new users and developers to the Ergo ecosystem.\n\n/// details | Wen 'Marketing?'\n     {type: warning, open: true}\nThe Ergo Foundation takes a principled approach to marketing and promotion, focusing on empowering community-driven initiatives and fostering organic growth. For ethical and legal reasons, the Foundation does not directly control outward marketing efforts. Instead, it aims to support and enable community-driven innovation through initiatives like the [Ecosystem Grant Framework](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/Ergo-Foundation-Announces-New-Initiative-to-Accelerate-Ecosystem-Growth/) and donations to community-led projects like the Sigmanauts.\n\nNetwork effects have been a significant driver of value creation in the tech industry, accounting for approximately 70% of value creation over the past 23 years. For a grassroots, third-generation blockchain like Ergo, this figure is likely even higher. While the Ergo Foundation strives to lay the foundations and help ignite community outreach and compounding growth, the ultimate promotion and adoption of Ergo rests principally on the shoulders of the community. The Foundation's role is to empower and support the community's efforts, fostering a self-sustaining and vibrant ecosystem. [(Get Involved!)](contribute.md)\n///\n\nThe EF does not commonly pay for influencers or ad campaigns and does its best to restrict frivolous spending, which is deemed not cost-effective (i.e., airdrops, giveaways). This approach reflects the Foundation's commitment to responsible and sustainable growth, focusing on building a strong foundation and fostering a vibrant community rather than relying on short-term marketing tactics.\n\nThe outreach department highlights projects building in the ecosystem. However, these initiatives do not constitute an endorsement from the Ergo Foundation. The Foundation will always use best practices to vet projects and ensure that there is no risk for potential users. Still, in the early stages of development, it is often unknowable if anything of substance will ultimately be produced. This cautious approach aims to protect users and maintain the integrity of the Ergo ecosystem."

For transparency, these roles are listed below:\n\n- Morphic manages JVM-related developers (Wallet devs, Scala devs, etc.) and the [sigmastate-interpreter](sigmastate-interpreter.md). (salaried)\n- Mark Glasgow manages this documentation and various other developer-adjacent tasks. (salaried)\n- Mohammad Hasan Samadani (mhs_sam) manages a team of graduates and PhD students who have produced [Ergo Raffle](ergoraffle.md), [ErgoWell](ergowell.md), [Minotaur-wallet](wallets.md), and [Rosen Bridge](rosen.md). (rewarded until April 2024 - now working on a volunteer basis)\n- [Fleet-sdk](https://github.com/fleet-sdk) is managed by Alison Robson (anon_br).

      "content": "/// admonition | For a detailed overview of current efforts, view the [public grist](https://ergo.getgrist.com/jf9KPR1HUDJH/Project-Management/p/28).\n    type: info\n///\n\n\nThe Ergo Foundation, as a legal entity, is primarily responsible for liaising with centralized exchanges. Ergo has been listed on several exchanges, including three *Tier 1* exchanges (KuCoin, gate.io, Huobi). A *Tier 1* exchange is defined as an exchange that appears in the top 10 of exchange ranking sites such as [defillama.com/cexs](https://defillama.com/cexs).\n\nExchange discussions and details are typically confidential due to Non-Disclosure Agreements ('NDA'). However, we can share some general insights:\n\n- Listings are usually expensive.\n- Exchanges generally do not buy liquidity or any of the native tokens or coins on the open market. Instead, a third-party Market Maker ('MM') is used, which has access to an API with a preallocated amount of ERG and USDT to create a liquid market. The MM can only buy/sell and lacks the credentials to withdraw assets.\n- The Ergo Foundation has approached all major exchanges, and none have been rejected due to high costs.\n\nIf you're wondering why certain coins are listed and Ergo is not, it could be due to several reasons:\n\n- They are a native asset on an already integrated chain (e.g., ERC20, Cosmos), which requires less effort to add and maintain.\n- They may have venture-capitalist funding and connections, which can be leveraged for early listings.\n- They may have a smaller public distribution than ERG and can negotiate with exchanges for a percentage of their total supply.\n- They may be less complex than Ergo, with no native asset support, no need to worry about UTXO dust, etc.\n- They may be older than Ergo and were listed during the last bear market.\n- Even though they are a unique Layer-1, they may only have a wrapped asset (e.g., on BSC) listed.\n\nThe Ergo Foundation is committed to expanding Ergo's presence on exchanges. However, certain factors such as low volume or market cap can affect our eligibility for listing on some platforms. This is not due to a lack of effort or resources but rather the nature of the crypto market and the specific requirements of different exchanges.\n\nWe are also exploring the possibility of listing as wrapped tokens on exchanges, which could reduce barriers for high-quality tier 2/3 exchanges and help build up our access and volume. We are actively pursuing discussions with a global on-ramp to increase access for US users.\n\nWhile Ergo's fundamentals are strong, the decision to list a coin often comes down to factors such as profitability and ease of integration for the exchange. However, we believe that as Ergo's DeFi ecosystem matures and volume builds up, more exchanges will recognize its value and list it.\n\nIn the meantime, we continue to prioritize development and community engagement over artificially inflating volume or engaging in questionable practices. We believe this approach will lead to sustainable growth and long-term success for Ergo.\n\n/// details | The Ergo Foundation's Future\n     {type: info, open: true}\nPlease see [this page](ef-future.md) for more information on the long-term goals of The Foundation.\n///"
