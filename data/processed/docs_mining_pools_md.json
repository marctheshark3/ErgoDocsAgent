  "summary": "Mining Pools are groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of finding a block, with the reward split among the pool members proportionally. While larger pools win blocks more frequently, long-term earnings are roughly the same regardless of pool size. Dual mining allows mining Ergo alongside other coins. Solo mining is an option for those who wish to operate independently. Several mining pools offer a solo port. Resources and a list of popular Ergo mining pools are provided. SmartPools are a decentralized alternative to traditional mining pools, using autonomous on-chain smart contracts.",

      "question": "What are mining pools?",
      "answer": "Mining pools are groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of finding a block. The reward is then split among the pool members, proportional to the amount of work they contributed."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do earnings and pool size relate?",
      "answer": "While larger pools win blocks more frequently and can provide more consistent payouts, your long-term earnings should be roughly the same regardless of the pool size. In smaller pools, you might not receive a payout until the pool wins a block."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is dual mining?",
      "answer": "Dual mining allows you to mine Ergo alongside other coins such as KAS and ALPH."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is solo mining?",
      "answer": "Solo mining is an option for those who wish to operate independently of mining pools. This requires setting up a node and stratum server, which can be done by following the instructions provided in our guide."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can I find a list of mining pools that offer a solo port?",
      "answer": "A comprehensive list of pools offering a solo port can be found on Mining Pool Stats."
