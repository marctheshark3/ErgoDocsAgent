This is necessary to run OpenJDK-8 in Ubuntu, as it is currently unavailable for the base Linux environment in Android.\n\n```bash\npkg install proot-distro\n```\n\nThe next step is to download Ubuntu with proot-distro.\n\n```bash\nproot-distro install ubuntu\n```\n\nNow we need to log in to Ubuntu. \n\n```bash\nproot-distro login ubuntu\n```\n\nAnd now, we need to update Ubuntu; then, we can install wget and OpenJDK-8.\n\n```bash\napt-get update\n```\n```bash\napt-get install wget openjdk-8-jdk\n```"

You can find a keyboard called Hacker's Keyboard in F-Droid that worked great for me.\n\nInstalling a package called tmux will help if you want to run other programs alongside the Ergo Mixer within Termux. It is possible to run the Ergo node in one tmux pane and the mixer in another."
