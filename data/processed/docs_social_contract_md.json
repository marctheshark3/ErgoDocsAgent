  "summary": "Ergo's Social Contract outlines the key principles that should guide the development and evolution of the Ergo protocol. The main principles are: 1) Prioritizing decentralization and minimizing the influence of any single party; 2) Serving the interests of regular people rather than big parties; 3) Focusing on providing an efficient, secure and easy platform for financial contracts; 4) Aiming for long-term sustainability and resilience; and 5) Maintaining a permissionless and open protocol that does not restrict or discriminate against any usage.",

      "answer": "Ergo's main focus is to provide an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts."

    {
      "question": "What is the principle of Decentralization First in Ergo?",
      "answer": "Ergo should be as decentralized as possible, and any parties whose absence or malicious behavior may affect the security of the network should be avoided."

    {
      "question": "How is Ergo designed for regular people?",
      "answer": "Ergo is a platform for ordinary people, and their interests should not be infringed upon in favor of big parties. This means that centralization of mining should be prevented and regular people should be able to participate in the protocol by running a full node and mining blocks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the principle of Long-term Focus in Ergo?",
      "answer": "All aspects of Ergo development should be focused on a long-term perspective, and Ergo should be able to survive for centuries without expected hard forks, software or hardware improvements or some other unpredictable changes."

      "question": "What is Ergo's Social Contract?",
      "answer": "Ergo's Social Contract defines the main principles that should be followed in Ergo, which include Decentralization First, Created for Regular People, and Long-term Focus."

In this section, we define the main principles that should be followed in Ergo which might be referred to as **Ergo's Social Contract**.\n\nIn case of intentional violation of any of these principles, the resulting protocol should not be called Ergo."
