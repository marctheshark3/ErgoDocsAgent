  "title": "External Tools & Simulators for ErgoScript Debugging",
  "summary": "This document discusses the external tools and simulators available for debugging ErgoScript, the scripting language used in the Ergo blockchain. It highlights the importance of these off-chain tools in testing and understanding ErgoScript contract behavior, given the limitations of direct on-chain debugging. The document covers three main categories of tools:\n\n1. Simulators, such as the Spectrum Finance ErgoScript Simulator, which allow for off-chain execution of ErgoScript code.\n2. SDK Playgrounds and REPLs, like the ones provided by the Fleet SDK, which offer interactive environments for experimenting with script snippets and context building.\n3. Online editors and compilers, such as escript.online, which help with writing scripts and catching syntax errors.\n\nThe document also mentions the community's desire for more sophisticated debugging tools, including enhanced simulators with features like breakpoints, step-through execution tracing, and detailed state inspection capabilities. It emphasizes that using these external tools effectively complements the core practices of thorough testing and careful design.",

      "question": "What is the purpose of external tools and simulators for ErgoScript debugging?",
      "answer": "External tools and off-chain simulators play a vital role in testing and understanding ErgoScript contract behavior in a controlled environment, given the limitations of direct on-chain debugging."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Spectrum Finance ErgoScript Simulator?",
      "answer": "The Spectrum Finance ErgoScript Simulator is a community-developed tool specifically designed for simulating ErgoScript execution, providing more insight into evaluation steps and intermediate results than simple unit tests."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the potential features of the Fleet SDK Playground or REPL?",
      "answer": "The Fleet SDK ecosystem may include online playgrounds or command-line REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tools that allow developers to quickly test small ErgoScript fragments, context construction, or serialization/deserialization logic."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is escript.online?",
      "answer": "escript.online is an online editor and compiler for ErgoScript, useful for writing scripts, checking syntax, and seeing the compiled ErgoTree output."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key benefits of using external tools and simulators for ErgoScript debugging?",
      "answer": "External tools and simulators allow developers to execute ErgoScript code off-chain, mimicking the on-chain environment to varying degrees, and provide more insight into the behavior of ErgoScript contracts in a controlled environment."
