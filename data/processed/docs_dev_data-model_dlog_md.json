  "title": "Discrete Logarithm Proofs in Ergo",
  "summary": "The document provides an overview of discrete logarithm proofs in the Ergo blockchain platform. It explains that these proofs are a fundamental cryptographic primitive used in Ergo's signature verification mechanism, based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem in elliptic curve cryptography. The document covers the key characteristics of these proofs, including their cryptographic foundation, the use of Schnorr signatures, and the technical details of the proof structure. It also discusses related cryptographic concepts such as Sigma protocols, threshold signatures, and ring signatures. The document describes the implementation of discrete logarithm proofs in ErgoScript and provides practical examples, as well as discussing security considerations and advanced applications of this technology in Ergo, including cryptographic foundations, the ZeroJoin privacy protocol, and sidechains interoperability.",
