Although built from the ground up, Ergo's scripts and transaction formats differ from Bitcoin's. For an in-depth understanding, refer to the [Ergo 'Box' model](box.md).\n- Ergo incorporates standard scripts, associated with `P2PK` addresses, much like Bitcoin. [Explore more about the address scheme here](address.md).\n- An Ergo UTXO box utilizes [registers](registers.md) to store arbitrary values, such as native tokens, rather than a single amount (like BTC). Each box holds an ERG amount and may include {tokenid, token amount} pairs, adhering to the UTXO model.\n- Ergo's built-in wallet API caters to most use cases. The API employs a Swagger interface and operates on `127.0.0.1:9053` by default in the mainnet (`9052` on the [testnet](testnet.md)).\n- The precision of each transaction on the Ergo platform is up to $10^{-9}$ ERG.

      "heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "**Can P2S and P2SH be two address formats for the same script?**\n\nYes. For P2S, the script is serialized directly into the address. For P2SH, the address contains only a hash of the serialized script.\n\n**Are there issues with supporting address types other than P2PK?**\n\nSupporting other types isn't a problem if the user is aware of what they're doing, but this is often not the case and can introduce complexity. P2S addresses can't validate input size in forms.\n\n**How are ergoTree and address related for conversions?**\n\nIn appkit, `Address.create()` accepts an address string and returns an object from which you can obtain the ergoTree.\n\n**Transaction Fees**\n\n\nErgo's transaction fee system is designed to be flexible and explicit. Although the protocol does not enforce a specific minimum transaction fee, it employs a spam-prevention strategy that requires each box to contain a minimum amount of ERG based on its size. This minimum value is determined by a parameter voted on by miners.\n\nAs a guideline, it is suggested to allocate **0.001 ERG (1,000,000 NanoErg) for each box** involved in the transaction. Including a fee incentivizes miners to process your transaction more quickly.\n\nMiners prioritize transactions based on either the fee per byte or the validation cost unit, which are adjustable via a voting mechanism among miners. Transaction fees are collected in a specific contract that can only be spent through a miner's script.\n\nTo determine the appropriate transaction fee, consider the protocol's minimum requirements based on the box size and the network's current hashrate. Higher hashrates reduce the risk of double-spend attacks, thus requiring fewer confirmations.\n\nFor more detailed information on transaction fees, including minimum values, miner prioritization, fee collection, and related topics, please refer to the dedicated [Transaction Fees](min-fee.md) page.\n\n**What algorithm generates a boxid?**\n\nThe boxid is generated by hashing the box contents.\n\n[See the code in AppKit for details](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/blob/9e19c13d82966eaee59433d16c4fb987bea363a7/lib-impl/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/impl/OutBoxBuilderImpl.scala#L66)\n\nA box's bytes are unique because they contain:  \n\n- The `id` of the parent transaction, \n- The output position in the transaction,\n- A unique transaction id.\n\n**Address Rules:**\n\n- address = prefix byte || content bytes || checksum\n- Prefix byte = network type + address type\n- checksum = leftmost_4_bytes (blake2b256 (prefix byte || content bytes))\n- For more information, refer to the [Address Types](../wallet/address/address_types.md) page.\n\n**Preventive Measures to Avoid Chain Forking:**\n\nErgo's view is that disruptive hard forks should be avoided in Ergo unless absolutely critical. Ergo implements various measures to prevent hard forks, such as pushing complexity to the application layer and enabling many things to be implemented via soft-forks.\n\nIf a supermajority (90%+) of the network accepts a new feature, it is activated; however, old nodes that do not upgrade continue to operate normally and skip over this feature validation.\n\n- **[Velvet-Fork](velvet-fork.md)**: Only requires a minority of nodes to upgrade. Introduced by the NiPoPoW paper, the key idea is that you can use the scheme even if only some blocks in the chain include the interlink structure and allows for \"gradual deployment\" without harming the miners that haven't upgraded to the new rules. In this way, it acts similar to a soft fork in that clients that upgrade to new rules are still compatible with those that don't.\n- **[Soft-fork](soft-fork.md):** Requires some nodes to upgrade. The recent re-emission Soft-Fork EIP37 was possible as it's enforced on miner nodes only via protocol rules. These can be approved with 90% support from miners.\n- **[Hard-Fork](hard-fork.md):** Requires all nodes to upgrade.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](eip.md).\n\n**51% Attack Prevention:**\n\n- Ergo utilizes the [Autolykos](autolykos.md) algorithm, a fairly launched efficient [ASIC-resistant](asic.md) Proof of Work algorithm to mitigate the risk of a 51% attack. [Mining pools](pools.md) offer a buffer against network attacks as the hash rate is distributed across thousands of individual miners. The memory-hardened aspect of Ergo also makes this attack vector more expensive as there is no ASIC support to rent.\n\n**Storage Rent:**\n\n- Ergo's design emphasizes long-term economic sustainability. One of the key strategies to ensure this is the implementation of [storage rent](storage-rent.md) or 'demurrage'. Storage rent is a nominal fee levied on unspent outputs after four years. The fee per byte is determined by the storage rent subprotocol. For a box without tokens and complex scripts, this amounts to approximately 0.14 ERG every four years.\n- For more information, refer to the [Storage Rent documentation](rent.md).\n\n**Does the node wallet need to expose its port? If so, is a machine with NAT IP okay?**\n\nWallet nodes do not necessarily need to expose their ports, although you can do if you want it to be available outside your local network. NAT IP is fine.\n\n**Whitelisting Node IP:**\n\nErgo does not require adding your node's IP to a whitelist for synchronization."

      "level": 3,
      "content": "**What is the difference between the value field and assets array in a box?**\nEach box always has an ERG value in the value field. Assets are optional and are represented in the assets array. A box can contain a combination of ERG and tokens.\n\n**What is the difference between inclusionHeight and creationHeight?**\nCreation height is when the transaction was built, but it's not reliable since the person building the transaction can input a number <= current block height. Inclusion height is the block number where the transaction was first included (first confirmation).\n\n**How can I get the block number of the first transaction confirmation?**\nCall /blocks/{blockId}/header to get the block height. The height in the header defines the block number in which the transactions from that block received their first confirmation.\n\n**Is the numConfirmations value returned by /blockchain/transaction/byId/{txId} the number of transaction confirmations?**\nYes, it is.\n\n**What is considered a safe number of confirmations?**\nA common practice is to use 10 confirmations for deposits, which takes about 20 minutes. Ergo doesn't have many forking events due to the relatively long block time.\n\n**What's the difference between /wallet/balances and /wallet/balances/withUnconfirmed endpoints?**\n/balances returns the balance excluding current unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. /balances/withUnconfirmed accounts for transactions in the mempool, returning the confirmed balance plus (or minus) unconfirmed transactions.\n\n**Which endpoint should be used to get the balance before sending a transaction?**\nWhen working with chained transactions, it's better to use /balances/withUnconfirmed to get the balance before sending a transaction, as it reflects the \"new wallet balance\" after sending the previous transaction."
