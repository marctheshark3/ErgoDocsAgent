By iterating over a register used as a nonce, a token with specific id properties can be created, requiring computational work similar to VanityGen-address in Bitcoin.

This id is computed through hashing.\n\nBy iterating over a register (for example, `R4`) used as a nonce, a token with specific id properties can be created. This could include ids starting with a certain number of zeroes. Therefore, some computational work may be required to generate such a token, similar to the VanityGen-address concept in Bitcoin, but applied to tokens.\n\nCertain contracts may only accept these Proof-of-Work backed Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\n\nWhile specific use-cases have not been fully explored, potential applications could include spam filtering.\n\nFor more detailed discussions, refer to this [link](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/proof-of-work-backed-tokens/224)."
