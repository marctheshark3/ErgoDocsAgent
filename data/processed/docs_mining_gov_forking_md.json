  "summary": "The document provides an overview of Ergo's approach to forking, which aims to avoid disruptive hard forks unless absolutely critical. Ergo implements measures to prevent hard forks, such as pushing complexity to the application layer and enabling soft-forks. The document outlines different fork types, including velvet-forks, soft-forks, and hard-forks, and the fork activation process, which involves proposal, consensus, and supermajority (90%+) approval. Ergo's goal is to maintain a stable and secure network while enabling continuous improvement and innovation.",

Introduced by the NiPoPoW paper, the key idea is that you can use the scheme even if only some blocks in the chain include the interlink structure and allows for \"gradual deployment\" without harming the miners that haven't upgraded to the new rules. In this way, it acts similar to a soft fork in that clients that upgrade to new rules are still compatible with those that don't.\n- [**Soft-fork:**](soft-fork.md) Requires some nodes to upgrade. The recent re-emission Soft-Fork EIP37 was possible as it's enforced on miner nodes only via protocol rules. These can be approved with 90% support from miners.\n- [**Hard-Fork:**](hard-fork.md) Requires all nodes to upgrade."

      "heading": "Fork Activation Process",

      "content": "When a new feature or change is proposed, it goes through the following process:\n\n1. **Proposal and Discussion**: The proposed change is discussed and evaluated by the Ergo community and developers.\n2. **Consensus and Approval**: If the proposal gains consensus and is approved, it is scheduled for implementation.\n3. **Fork Type Determination**: Based on the nature of the change, it is determined whether a velvet-fork, soft-fork, or hard-fork is required.\n4. **Activation**: If a supermajority (90%+) of the network accepts the new feature, it is activated. Old nodes that do not upgrade continue to operate normally and skip over the new feature validation.\n\nBy following this process and leveraging the various fork types, Ergo aims to maintain a stable and secure network while enabling continuous improvement and innovation."
