  "summary": "Bonding curves are a useful primitive for continuous token offerings (CTOs), augmented bonded curves, and perhaps AMM DEXes. There is a cheap way to do bonding curves on Ergo, with most of the load performed off-chain. The document discusses two scenarios: a sell-only token sale and a sell with buy-back scenario. In the sell-only scenario, the token issuer creates boxes with a set price for the token in register R4, and the box is spendable if the spending transaction pays the price to the issuer's address. In the sell with buy-back scenario, the selling contract requires a spending transaction to lock 95% of the price, at least with buying contract, which is time-locked and requires a spending transaction to send the token bought-back to a predefined address. Clients need to perform some work to find boxes associated with the token and selling-script, and then sort the boxes by R4.",

This is a very simple example of a bonding curve. See [this article](https://blog.relevant.community/bonding-curves-in-depth-intuition-parametrization-d3905a681e0a) for more details. \n\nSell-only \n-------------\n\nFirst, assume a token sale scenario only. The token issuer creates 100 boxes with one token each, with a set price for the token in register R4 of a box. The box is spendable if the spending transaction pays the price to the issuer's address (issuer's script in general). \n\n\nSell with buy-back\n--------------------------\n\nNow assume that token sell comes with a buy-back guarantee, e.g. seller is buying back tokens within one year since selling for 95% of the selling price. The selling contract requires a spending transaction to lock 95% of the price, at least with buying contract. Buying contract is time-locked and requires a spending transaction to send token bought-back to a predefined address (e.g. issuer's).\n\n\nClients\n----------\n\nAs the curve is made upon many boxes, some work is required on the client-side, namely the possibility of finding boxes associated with the token and selling-script, and then sorting the boxes by R4."
