This certification allows WEQNT and EXLE to legally issue microcredit and crypto-based loans, providing local businesses with fair and competitive loan options. This access to micro loans fosters the growth of new businesses and promotes social and economic engagement in the region.\n\n- [Introducing the first Micro-Credit Cooperative in Northern Kenyawith - lowest interest rates - WEQNT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA7iAvlKG2Y&t=3s)"
