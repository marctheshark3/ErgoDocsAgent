We\u2019ll use [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) to implement a simple ErgoPay REST API. Spring has the following benefits why we\u2019ve chosen it here: It\u2019s JVM-based, and [ergo-appkit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit), one of Ergo\u2019s SDKs, is also JVM-based. It\u2019s easy and boilerplate-free, tons of tutorials and information is available, it runs on your local machine with ease. There are both free and paid services to get the application deployed to the public.\n\nOf course, you are free to use any other programming language and framework you are experienced with and adapt the concepts outlined here.\nWe won\u2019t cover the implementation of the UI side of your dApp here, but the code of the ErgoPay showcase dApp is [open-sourced](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergopay-frontend-example) and of course, you can use it as you wish."

If you don\u2019t have one installed yet, use OpenJDK on Linux or install [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) on Windows. Head over and [generate a fresh Spring Boot project with the initializr](https://start.spring.io/). Change the information in the form as you like, for this tutorial you only need to add the \u201cSpring web\u201d dependency. If you don\u2019t use Eclipse I would also recommend switching to \u201cGradle project\u201d. Download and extract the generated project and open it with your IDE.\n\nYou can start your application with Gradle by typing\n\n```bash\n./gradlew bootRun // MacOS/Linux\ngradlew bootRun   // Windows\n```\n\nThis prints out that the server is running on http://localhost:8080/ now. But as we didn\u2019t do something, it\u2019s not of much use, so you can stop it with Ctrl-C.\nTo get more familiar with how a REST API is implemented using Spring, you should now follow the [Spring Quick Start](https://spring.io/quickstart) and implement the Hello World endpoint before proceeding here."

    {
      "heading": "Adding an ErgoPay request endpoint",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Now it is time to build your first ErgoPay request endpoint. Such an endpoint is a GET REST API method that returns an \u201cErgoPayResponse\u201d in its response body. ErgoPayResponse is a JSON-based data interchange format between a dApp and a wallet app and is described in [Ergo Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/) 0020.\n\nAt first, we need to declare this response data type as a Java Object. \n\nAdd the following file to your Spring Boot project:\n\n```java\npackage org.ergoplatform.ergopay;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude;\n\npublic class ErgoPayResponse {\n    @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)\n    public String message;\n    @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)\n    public Severity messageSeverity;\n    @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)\n    public String address;\n    @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)\n    public String reducedTx;\n    @JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)\n    public String replyTo;\n\n    enum Severity { NONE, INFORMATION, WARNING, ERROR }\n}\n```\n\nTo send this back as the response body of an endpoint, simply declare this new class as the return type of a RestController method. Spring Boot will automatically handle serialization to JSON format. Such a method could be declared as follows:\n\n```java\n@GetMapping(\"/ergopay/\")\npublic ErgoPayResponse ergoPayError() {\n     ErgoPayResponse response = new ErgoPayResponse();\n     response.messageSeverity = ErgoPayResponse.Severity.ERROR;\n     response.message = \"Nothing implemented yet.\";\n     return response;\n}\n```\n\nThis is already a valid ErgoPay response and endpoint. It does not serve a transaction, but will only present an error message to the users in their wallet apps.\nIf you start your Spring Boot application now and open http://localhost:8080/ergopay in your local web browser, you\u2019ll see the JSON response in your browser.\nUse the endpoint from the wallet application\n\nIt\u2019s all good to see the response in your browser, but of course you want to see this in a wallet app. If you have a mobile device with the Ergo wallet app 1.6 or higher installed and it is connected to the same network than the machine running the Spring Boot application, you can test this. Generally, you just need to replace the \u201chttp(s)\u201d prefix with \u201cergopay\u201d and wrap the URL into a QR code to scan it with the wallet app. In this specific case, you must also replace \u201clocalhost\u201d (which is only correct on the same machine) with the IP address of your computer within the network. So the URL wrapped into the QR code should look something like this:\n```bash\nergopay://192.168.0.1:8080/ergopay\n```\n\nNow generate a QR code from this URL, for example on www.qrstuff.com. Make sure to generate a static URL. Scan it; when everything worked well, you\u2019ll see the error message we defined above in the wallet app."

      "heading": "Building and reducing a transaction",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "The spice of ErgoPay is building a transaction on the dApp side and let the user sign it. For this, ErgoPayResponse has a field \u201creducedTx\u201d. But how to build a transaction and \u201creduce\u201d it? For this, we need to integrate the Ergo SDK into our Spring Boot project. To pull in the SDK, edit the build.gradle file of your Spring project and add the following line in the dependencies section, right below the spring-boot-starter-web dependency declaration:\n\n```java\ndependencies {\n   implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'\n*  implementation 'org.ergoplatform:ergo-appkit_2.11:4.0.6'\n\n   testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'\n}\n```\n\nWhen this is done, you can add the following helper method that builds a transaction for sending a certain amount of nanoERG from \u201csender\u201d to \u201crecipient\u201d:\n\n```java\n    // This function takes in boolean, long, address of sender and address of recipient\n    // and returns a reduced transaction object.\n    private ReducedTransaction getReducedSendTx(boolean isMainNet, long amountToSend, Address sender, Address recipient) {\n        // Determine the network type\n        NetworkType networkType = isMainNet ? NetworkType.MAINNET : NetworkType.TESTNET;\n        // Create a REST API client with default explorer url\n        return RestApiErgoClient.create(\n                getDefaultNodeUrl(isMainNet),\n                networkType,\n                \"\",\n                RestApiErgoClient.getDefaultExplorerUrl(networkType)\n        ).execute(ctx -> {\n            // Create a new Ergo contract with the recipient's Ergo address\n            ErgoTreeContract contract = new ErgoTreeContract(recipient.getErgoAddress().script());\n            // Create an unsigned transaction to put the given amount of funds to the contract\n            UnsignedTransaction unsignedTransaction = BoxOperations.putToContractTxUnsigned(ctx,\n                    Collections.singletonList(sender),\n                    contract, amountToSend, Collections.emptyList());\n            // Use a new prover builder to build the transaction and reduce it\n            return ctx.newProverBuilder().build().reduce(unsignedTransaction, 0);\n        });\n    }\n\n    // Constants for mainnet and testnet nodes\n    public static final String NODE_MAINNET = \"http://213.239.193.208:9053/\";\n    public static final String NODE_TESTNET = \"http://213.239.193.208:9052/\";\n\n    // Get the default node URL based on the network type\n    private static String getDefaultNodeUrl(boolean mainNet) {\n        return mainNet ? NODE_MAINNET : NODE_TESTNET;\n    }\n\n```\n\nOf course, you should change the node address to your own node you run for your dApp.\n\nIf you take a look at the source of `BoxOperations.java` included in appkit, you\u2019ll see how the called [putToContractTxUnsigned](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/blob/eef262b48cd14ba3d3f8a71201aabbbe28680302/lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/BoxOperations.java#L176) method works: it fetches and selects the available unspent boxes for the given sender address and constructs the unsigned transaction by adding the input boxes and defining three output boxes: The box storing amountToSend for the recipient, a box for the transaction fee, and a change box returning the contents of the input boxes that shouldn\u2019t be sent to the recipient. You are free to come up with completely own code here. This tutorial focuses on communicating with the wallet app and we\u2019ll only use this send transaction, but you can take a look at the [appkit Getting started guide](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit/wiki/Tutorial-starting-with-Appkit-on-Gradle-projects#what-to-start-with) to get more ideas.\n\nNow, all we have to do is add a method that wraps this helper method into a GET request REST API endpoint returning an ErgoPayResponse. We can do it like this:\n\n```java\n    @GetMapping(\"/roundTrip/{address}\")\n    public ErgoPayResponse roundTrip(@PathVariable String address) {\n        // sends 1 ERG around to and from the address\n        \n\n        ErgoPayResponse response = new ErgoPayResponse();\n\n        try {\n            boolean isMainNet = isMainNetAddress(address);\n            long amountToSend = 1000L * 1000L * 1000L;\n            Address sender = Address.create(address);\n            Address recipient = Address.create(address);\n\n            byte[] reduced = getReducedSendTx(isMainNet, amountToSend, sender, recipient).toBytes();\n\n            response.reducedTx = Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString(reduced);\n            response.address = address;\n            response.message = \"Here is your 1 ERG round trip.\";\n            response.messageSeverity = ErgoPayResponse.Severity.INFORMATION;\n\n        } catch (Throwable t) {\n            response.messageSeverity = ErgoPayResponse.Severity.ERROR;\n            response.message = (t.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        return response;\n    }\n```\n\nOur endpoint only expects a single parameter: an address. We use this address to construct a transaction to sent 1 ERG (= 10\u2079 nanoERG) to and from (lines 9 to 13). This transaction gets serialized and Base64 Url-encoded and is added to the response in line 15, along with an informative message for the user (lines 17/18).\nIt is important to catch all exceptions that could be thrown and use the error messages in the response back to the user. For example, an exception will be thrown for every address that does not have enough balance to send 1 ERG. When you catch the exception like this, the user will get the error message presented \u2014 not a very beautiful one, there is lots of space left to polish this for a professional dApp. But if you don\u2019t catch the error here, Spring will respond to the requesting wallet app with a server error, and you can place all bets that this will be more ugly for end users and won\u2019t make your dApp look professional.\nWhen you now try this endpoint manually, you\u2019ll need to add a testnet or mainnet address:\n\n```bash\nhttp://localhost:8080/roundTrip/<address>\n```\n\nWhen trying the endpoint with your wallet app, you don\u2019t need to do this \u2014 ErgoPay defines a placeholder that wallet applications fill with the address a user-selected. Wrap an address like this into a QR code to try:\n\n```bash\nergopay://<yourIP>:8080/roundTrip/#P2PK_ADDRESS#\n```\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that this is enough and you can sign and send the transaction from the wallet app."

      "content": "Now it\u2019s time to start experimenting with building other types of transactions. \n\nAlso check out the ErgoPay example server project \u2014 its [ErgoPayController.java](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergopay-server-example/blob/master/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/ergopay/ErgoPaySampleController.java) file defines some more endpoints: minting tokens, burning tokens, and spending a specific box.\n\nYou can also just use the getReducedSendTx method to issue payments on behalf of the user to yourself, for example as a payment service. The great thing is that you know the transaction id beforehand: every detail of the transaction is already known when the Reduced Transaction is built, and you can save this transaction id in your backend db and monitor the blockchain to observe when the payment was made to proceed with delivering the goods or services the user paid for.\nYou know enough now to build something like the token minter and box spender of the ErgoPay showcase app. For the token burner, we need one more feature: Connecting a wallet to the dApp UI."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Connect a wallet to your UI",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "Connecting a wallet is not needed in general, as you\u2019ve seen: for a payment or minting a token, you don\u2019t need to know the user\u2019s wallet address to collect or validate the data from the user. It is enough to know the address when the transaction is built on request of the wallet app. But for specific use cases, you might need the wallet address more early: The showcase dApp ships a token burner example. For showing the list of owned tokens to choose from, connecting a wallet is needed before the actual transaction is built.\n\nIndeed, we can obtain the address with all ErgoPay ingredients we already learned about. But we need to introduce some kind of session management on the dApp backend. Chances are high that you already have some kind of session running for the user. For example if your dApp is a web shop, you probably already store the items added to the cart.\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have any type of session management running, we\u2019ll implement the simplest kind of it now: every user of your dApp has a unique ID (\u201cuuid\u201d) that is randomly chosen by your frontend UI. This uuid is used as a session id. On the backend, we store a user\u2019s P2PK address mapped to this id.\nOur backend needs two API endpoints: one for the wallet app to send a user\u2019s address to store it attached to the uuid, and one for the frontend UI to request if the user address is set. \n\nThe following two methods do this:\n\n```java\n    @GetMapping(\"/getUserAddress/{sessionId}\")\n    public String getUserAddress(@PathVariable String sessionId) {\n        UserData userData = sessionService.getUserData(sessionId);\n\n        return (userData.p2pkAddress != null) ? userData.p2pkAddress : \"\";\n    }\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/setAddress/{sessionId}/{address}\")\n    public ErgoPayResponse setAddress(@PathVariable String sessionId, @PathVariable String address) {\n        UserData userData = sessionService.getUserData(sessionId);\n\n        ErgoPayResponse response = new ErgoPayResponse();\n\n        // check the address\n        try {\n            boolean isMainNet = isMainNetAddress(address);\n\n            response.address = address;\n            userData.p2pkAddress = address;\n            response.message = \"Connected to your address \" + address + \".\\n\\nYou can now continue using the dApp.\";\n            response.messageSeverity = ErgoPayResponse.Severity.INFORMATION;\n\n        } catch (Throwable t) {\n            response.messageSeverity = ErgoPayResponse.Severity.ERROR;\n            response.message = (t.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        return response;\n    }\n```\n\nWe don\u2019t cover the exact implementation of the [SessionService](https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/ergopay-server-example/blob/master/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/ergopay/UserSessionService.java) here. In our example, it is just holding a HashMap that gets invalidated after some time. This works for a simple backend and for our demonstration purpose, but you should rely on better session management implementations when using it for a dApp that is under real pressure. The whole point is that it connects your frontend UI session with the user\u2019s wallet application.\n\nNow when you need the user to connect a wallet to your dApp UI, you need to present a waiting UI with a QR code. This QR code contains the ErgoPay endpoint URL to set the user\u2019s address. In our example, it would be\n\n```\nergopay://<yourIP>:8080/setAddress/<sessionId>/#P2PK_ADDRESS#\n```\n\nRemember, `\u201c#P2PK_ADDRESS#\u201d` is a placeholder that will be replaced by the wallet app. The session id needs to be set by your frontend.\nThis ErgoPay URL makes the wallet app call the setAddress endpoint method with the necessary data, and on next call to the getUserAddress endpoint, your frontend UI will obtain the user\u2019s address. It\u2019s as simple as that. :-)"

This won\u2019t work when users visit your dApp on the same device that the wallet app is running on \u2014 they simply can\u2019t scan a QR code from the same device. Fortunately, you can simply show the ErgoPay URLs as a link for these users. If the user has a compatible wallet app installed, clicking or tapping such a link will open the wallet application processing the ErgoPay request."
