  "title": "Multi-Stage Transactions",
  "summary": "Multi-stage transactions involve multiple steps, where each step is a separate transaction that must be successfully executed to complete a larger objective. They are often used in complex real-world scenarios on the blockchain, such as escrow services, staged payments, or multi-party agreements. A classic example is the pin-lock contract, where multiple layers of validation or condition checks must be met before the final transaction can occur. \n\nThe document uses a traditional lending process as an example of a multi-stage transaction on the blockchain. The process includes stages such as loan request, loan approval and funding, loan utilization, repayment, and completion. Each step is a separate transaction that is linked to the success of the previous one, making the entire process a multi-stage transaction.",

      "content": "Multi-stage transactions involve multiple steps, where each step is a separate transaction that must be successfully executed to complete a larger objective. Unlike simple one-to-one transfers, these transactions require coordination across various stages, often governed by intricate smart contract logic.\n\nFor example, multi-stage transactions may be required in scenarios involving complex conditions or timed events, such as escrow services, staged payments, or multi-party agreements. Each stage relies on the execution of a preceding step, making the entire process more secure and robust.\n\nA classic illustration of a multi-stage transaction is the **pin-lock contract**, where multiple layers of validation or condition checks must be met before the final transaction can occur. The complexity of multi-stage transactions can vary, but their key feature is the chaining of multiple transactions to complete a scenario."

      "content": "1. **Loan Request Stage**:\n   - **Real World**: A borrower requests a loan from a lender with agreed terms, such as the loan amount and interest rate.\n   - **Blockchain**: The borrower creates a smart contract (or box) requesting funds. This smart contract includes conditions, such as the repayment terms and the interest rate.\n\n2. **Loan Approval and Funding Stage**:\n   - **Real World**: The lender approves the request and disburses the loan.\n   - **Blockchain**: The lender funds the borrower\u2019s smart contract, which triggers the transfer of funds to the borrower upon satisfying the conditions set in the contract.\n\n3. **Loan Utilization Stage**:\n   - **Real World**: The borrower uses the loan for business purposes.\n   - **Blockchain**: The borrower accesses the funded box, transferring the loaned amount into their own account for use.\n\n4. **Repayment Stage** (This is where the multi-stage aspect becomes evident):\n   - **Real World**: The borrower repays the loan with interest in agreed-upon installments.\n   - **Blockchain**: The borrower initiates a series of transactions, where each monthly repayment is a separate transaction executed on the blockchain. These repayments continue until the full amount (plus interest) has been transferred back to the lender.\n\n5. **Completion Stage**:\n   - **Real World**: The loan agreement concludes when the borrower pays off the debt.\n   - **Blockchain**: The smart contract governing the loan automatically closes once the final repayment transaction is executed, concluding the multi-stage process."

The loan cannot be funded until the borrower\u2019s smart contract is created, and repayments cannot occur until the funds are utilized.
