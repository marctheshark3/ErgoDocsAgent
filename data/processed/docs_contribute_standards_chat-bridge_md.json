  "summary": "Chat Bridge: Ergo ecosystem projects can establish a channel bridged between their server/Telegram using matterbridge. The document provides steps to set up the bridge, including inviting the BridgeBot to the Discord server and the ErgoBridgeBot to Telegram. Known limitations include Discord not allowing bots to reply to messages when spoofing someone, and the Telegram API not reporting deleted messages. Despite these limitations, the bridge works quite well, with names/profile-photos spoofed if similar on both platforms, and responses replying to the message on Telegram platforms and quoted on Discord.",

However, you will need to send the `Token` ID to @Glasgow if you want it bridged to existing Ergo chats. **The bot only needs permission to see/read messages and set webhooks in the channel you want to bridge.** \n\n**2.** Invite [ErgoBridgeBot](https://t.me/ErgoBridgeBot) to your Telegram.\n\n> If Shieldy is enabled, you'll need to use `/allowInvitingBots`.  \n\n**3.** Notify @Glasgow about the channel/server you want to bridge so it can be added to the configuration."

      "content": "1. Discord does not currently allow bots to reply to messages when spoofing someone. \n\n      - [Allow webhooks to use reply messages#3282](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/3282)\n\n2. The [Telegram API does not report deleted messages](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki/FAQ#matterbridge-is-not-deleting-messages-from-telegram-to-other-bridges). \n      1. This means any spam deleted on Telegram will remain visible on Discord.  \n      2. **Workaround**: Restrict new Telegram users from speaking until they verify their identity. [OrgRobot](http://orgrobot.io/) is a useful tool for this, with a set of custom entry questions. This should stop most bots. (However, some spammers are real people and cannot be prevented.) \n\nDespite these limitations, the bridge works quite well. \n\n- If set, names/profile-photos will be spoofed if they are similar on both platforms. (Names can also be manually mapped). However, profile photos need to be re-cached when a new bridge is added. \n- Responses will reply to the message on Telegram platforms, triggering notifications. On Discord, the message will be quoted."
