  "summary": "The document discusses server-side development for blockchain applications. It explains that developers can use various tools to read data from the blockchain, compute using that data, and create transactions to be broadcast. The document lists several platforms that developers can use, including JVM, Rust, Node.js, Python, and Mosaik (a UI system for dApps). It also mentions a specific tool called the JSON dApp Environment.",
