It introduces SigmaUSD, the world's first UTxO-based stablecoin based on the AgeUSD protocol, designed by IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo. SigmaUSD maintains conservative collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations, with a fully decentralized stablecoin emission setup. The document also mentions Dexy, another stablecoin project on the Ergo platform that uses seigniorage. The document provides links to various resources with more information on the technical details and design of these stablecoin projects.",

      "content": "Blockchain assets can be extremely volatile. That\u2019s why investors often seek digital assets which are pegged to national currencies. A Stablecoin is the most primitive integration of cryptocurrencies with the off-chain world. Until DAI, fiat custody services were provided by centralized services. The first example of a stable coin, USDT, is backed by [actual dollars](https://cryptobriefing.com/external-auditor-first-confirm-tethers-usdt-backing/) held in banks. However, for a decentralized financial system, we need other means of fiat-pegged currencies."
