Choosing the right mode depends on your specific use case, such as running a backend for a dApp, securing personal funds, or simply verifying transactions.\n\nThe primary modes are configured using settings in your `ergo.conf` file, mainly `node.stateType` and `node.blocksToKeep`. Bootstrapping options like `node.utxoBootstrap` and `node.nipopowBootstrap` can significantly speed up the initial synchronization for certain modes but do not define the mode itself.\n\nHere's a comparison of the main operational modes:"

The node will attempt the fastest method available from peers.\n    *   Note \u00b9: While `utxoBootstrap` can technically be used with `stateType=\"digest\"`, it's less common as NiPoPoW bootstrap is generally preferred for this mode.\n    *   **Progress Indication:** Be aware that the initial download phase when using bootstrapping (especially `utxoBootstrap`) can take a significant amount of time depending on network speed and peer availability. The node logs may not show detailed progress during large snapshot downloads. It's often helpful to monitor your system's network activity or the increasing size of the node's data directory (`.ergo/snapshots` or similar) to gauge progress during this phase.\n\n2.  **Digest Mode (`stateType=\"digest\"`) Limitations:**\n    *   This mode keeps only an authenticated digest (root hash) of the UTXO set, verifying state transitions using [ADProofs](block-adproofs.md) contained in blocks.\n    *   **Wallet Compatibility:** While functional for creating new wallets and basic operations, users have reported issues submitting standard P2P transactions from wallets connected *only* to a digest-mode node. Compatibility with specific wallets or dApps requiring full UTXO set access may vary. **Verification is recommended.**\n    *   **API Limitations:** Some API endpoints that rely on scanning the full UTXO set might not be available or may return limited data.\n    *   **Peer Relaying:** Digest nodes typically cannot relay transactions received from peers, as they don't validate them against the full UTXO set.\n\n3.  **Wallet Restoration (Pruned & Digest Modes):**\n    *   Nodes running with `blocksToKeep` set to a positive value (Pruned and Digest modes) **cannot** be used to restore wallets from seed phrases if those wallets were used *before* the oldest block kept by the node. They lack the historical transaction data needed for the scan.\n    *   You **must** use an Archival Full Node (`blocksToKeep = -1`) or a trusted explorer service for restoring older wallets. For new wallets created and used *only* while the pruned/digest node is running, restoration might work, but using an archival node is the safest approach.\n\n4.  **Resource Usage:**\n    *   The storage figures are estimates and depend heavily on the `blocksToKeep` setting and chain activity. A typical light/mobile setup using digest mode with bootstrapping might initially consume around 3GB.\n    *   Memory requirements (`-Xmx` flag) also vary. While an archival node might need 8GB+, pruned/digest nodes can often run with 2-4GB, though more may be needed during intense activity or bootstrapping."
