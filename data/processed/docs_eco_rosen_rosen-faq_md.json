  "title": "FAQs: Rosen Bridge Operations and Features",
  "summary": "The document provides FAQs about the Rosen Bridge, which is a cross-chain bridge. Key points include:\n\n- The bridge fee structure is the greater of $10 or 0.5% of the transaction value, plus network fees, adjustable by the guard set.\n- There is no fixed maximum for a single transaction, but large transfers may take longer due to manual guard intervention.\n- ADA is managed by sending network fees in the transaction token on Ergo to a dedicated address to cover fees on Cardano.\n- Projects can add new token options by paying a listing fee to the Rosen Fund, which involves minting wrapped tokens and updating the token map.\n- The roadmap includes adding support for BTC, BSC, and Dogecoin in the midterm.\n- The team consists of 8 developers, with some frontend and UI tasks outsourced, and 2-3 additional part-time developers over the past year, supported by several advisors.",
