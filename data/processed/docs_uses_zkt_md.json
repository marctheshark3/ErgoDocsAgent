  "title": "Zero-Knowledge Treasury",
  "summary": "The document discusses Ergo's Zero-Knowledge Treasury, a powerful tool that enables users to create joint digital signatures with custom conditions for fund allocation while maintaining the anonymity of the signatories. It explains the concept of zero-knowledge cryptography and how it is applied in blockchain technology to enhance transaction privacy. The article also highlights Ergo's Sigma Protocols for generating composable zero-knowledge signatures and a community-driven initiative to simplify the creation of joint spending groups. The Zero-Knowledge Treasury is described as comprising a server app for proposals and fund requests, and a client app for generating the necessary proofs for approved proposals. The versatility of this feature is discussed, including its potential application in decentralized Public Key Infrastructure. The article concludes with gratitude and anticipation for this groundbreaking contribution to the Ergo community.",

    {
      "question": "How does Zero-Knowledge cryptography enhance transaction privacy in blockchain technology?",
      "answer": "With zero-knowledge signatures, the identity of signatories remains concealed, only revealing that the necessary number of signatures has been acquired to authorize a transaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Zero-Knowledge Treasury differ from a conventional multi-signature address on the Bitcoin blockchain?",
      "answer": "While a conventional multi-signature address reveals the signatories, Zero-Knowledge Treasury maintains the privacy of the signatories."

Instead of revealing the unlock code, which is sensitive, she unlocks the phone without revealing the code to you. This scenario mirrors a simple zero-knowledge proof where proof of ownership is established without sharing the actual data."

      "content": "In blockchain technology, ZK cryptography finds a fertile ground for numerous applications, significantly in enhancing transaction privacy. A conventional multi-signature address, like a two-of-three on the Bitcoin blockchain, requires signatures from two out of three private key holders to move funds. While secure, the transparency of blockchain reveals the signatories, compromising privacy."

The server app is open for proposals and fund requests, while the client app is set up by team members to interact with their secret, node, explorer, and server, creating the necessary proofs for approved proposals. Once a proposal gains full approval, client apps autonomously generate the required proofs and transactions, eliminating the need for manual intervention.\n\nFor a deeper dive into the Zero-Knowledge Treasury, visit the [Ergo forum discussion](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/zero-knowledge-treasury-on-top-of-ergo/354/3)."
