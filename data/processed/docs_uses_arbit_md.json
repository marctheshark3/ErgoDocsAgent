  "summary": "Arbit is a simple and intuitive arbitrage platform designed for decentralized trading on the Ergo and Cardano blockchains. It aims to simplify the arbitrage process, enabling users to identify and execute profitable swaps with minimal setup.\n\nArbit supports ERG, ADA, and RSN tokens, and integrates with the Ergo Dex and Splash exchanges. It provides predefined arbitrage strategies called \"Arbits\" that focus on simplicity and usability. The platform calculates profitability based on fixed token values ($50 and $100) to avoid complexity.\n\nThe document covers Arbit's key features, how it works, and deployment instructions for a local setup. It also describes the implemented arbitrage strategies, including the ERG \u2194 ADA arbitrage that leverages both direct and reverse swap paths.",

The platform identifies opportunities where a user can buy and sell tokens across different decentralized exchanges to make a profit.\n\n- **Supported Tokens:** ERG, ADA, and RSN.\n- **Supported Exchanges:** Ergo Dex and Splash.\n- **Core Features:**\n\n    - Predefined arbitrage strategies (called \"Arbits\").\n    - Focus on simplicity and usability.\n    - Execution of swaps with just a few clicks.\n\n**What is an Arbit?**\n\nAn Arbit is a series of swaps that generate profit. For example:\n\n1. Sell 100 X tokens on Exchange A for $100.\n2. Buy 105 Y tokens on Exchange B for the same $100.\n3. Profit from the additional 5 Y tokens.\n\n---"
