  "summary": "The JSON dApp Environment (JDE) is a programming tool that allows tech-savvy users and developers to interact with Ergo dApps using JSON as the programming language. It provides a \"sandbox\" mode where users can execute arbitrary scripts without worrying about malicious programs. JDE enables users to perform various tasks such as finding boxes, extracting values, performing computations, and creating transaction requests. It is designed to be user-friendly and enable remote hosting of the JDE service. The document provides details on the capabilities, usage, and important notes about the experimental nature of JDE.",

Enable tech-savvy users and developers to interact with existing (and future) Ergo dApps such as Sigma USD by programming the off-chain logic user-friendly. \n \n2. Provide a \"sandbox\" mode, where users can send arbitrary scripts for execution such that the server does not have to worry about malicious programs. This enables the JDE service to be hosted remotely. An example is [Kiosk-Web](https://kioskweb.org/session/#kiosk.Wallet.txBuilder), where you can post arbitrary scripts (such as [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ergoplatform/ergo-jde/main/sample-scripts/getReserveCoinInfo.json), which gets the reserve coin rate) in \"Tx Builder\" and obtain results.\n\nGoal #2 rules out many programming languages such as Java/Scala and Rust. This rules out all the so-called \"Turing-complete\" languages."

      "content": "Let us take the use-case of purchasing, say, 10 Sigma-USD reserve coins as an example, which involves the following steps: \n\n   1. Find the current oracle pool box and obtain the rate from register R4.\n   2. Find the current bank box and obtain the relevant parameters (tokens in circulation and base reserves).\n   3. Use the formulae to obtain the delta in base reserves. \n   4. Compute the details of the new bank box to be created (nano-Ergs, tokens, registers)\n   5. Compute the details of the new receipt box to be created (nano-Ergs, tokens, registers)\n   6. Make a transaction creation request to the Ergo node with the above details. \n\nAll the above tasks can be programmed in JDE, as done [in this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ergoplatform/ergo-jde/main/sample-scripts/mintReserveCoinAdvanced.json).  \n\nIn general, JDE allows us to do the following:\n\n1. Find some boxes by address and/or box Id\n2. Extract values from those boxes (nanoErgs, registers and tokens), and define variables using those.\n3. Define constant values\n4. Perform computation using the constants and variables. JDE supports the if-then-else construct for control flow. However, it does not support loops. \n5. Define outputs using the values computed\n6. Make a transaction creation request to the Ergo node"

      "content": "A compiled JAR is available on the [release](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-jde/releases) page. You can also generate the JAR yourself using the `sbt assembly` command. \n\nThe following are the steps in using JDE. \n\n1. Understand the scripting language by looking at the sample scripts and the documentation.\n2. Ensure you have a fully synced Ergo node running.\n3. Write your script or edit the existing script for the task at hand.\n4. Invoke JDE via CLI to generate a transaction creation request (aka unsigned transaction) and some returned values.\n\nDepending on your use case, you will be using the output of Step 4 differently.\n\n- End users will use it to send a transaction on the Ergo blockchain\n- Wallet authors will append some of their inputs/outputs before sending the transaction.\n- dApp authors will use the returned values for further computation.\n\nJDE also includes a web-service mode for the last two use-cases. \n\nPlease see the [documentation](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-jde/blob/main/readme.md) for details."
