  "summary": "The document discusses the mining incentives offered by SigmaUSD, a decentralized finance (DeFi) system built on the Ergo blockchain. Key points include:\n\n- SigmaRSV can offer project-oriented miners a way to maximize their positions by accumulating fees.\n- SigmaUSD can offer freelance miners liquidity to cover their expenses in a decentralized manner, free of exchanges.\n- SigmaUSD offers an incentive for miners to create greater price stability in the asset they are assisting in creating and maintaining.\n- Price stability assists miners in predicting future costs and revenues, and SigmaUSD can serve as a price stabilization mechanism.\n- Interacting with the SigmaUSD protocol is beneficial to all parties, compared to interacting with the open market.\n- Ergo's premise has always been a proof-of-work (PoW) system that can operate as a digital reserve of programmable gold.",

A decentralised system will have a variety of actors that allow the system to grow. Considering the proper incentives to serve the community's needs is essential. Ergo is built on solid technological foundations; the decentralised financial market is made with historical foundations in mind.\n\nTraditionally central banks held gold as reserves that backed currency. The currency was used as a stable medium of exchange throughout economies. When stable or backed by assets, this banking system allowed commerce and growth.\n\nWe have moved away from a system in which currency is backed by anything. The global reserve currency is run on a banking system with 0% reserve requirements. \n\nGovernments around the world are in the process of continually feeding liquidity into the global economy. Central banks globally are creating money and debt at unprecedented rates. This debt will burden countless future generations, or debts will reach a default and restructuring point.\n\nDigital Assets are a market alternative to the inflationary pressure of fiat currency. The \"law\" enshrined in the code creates scarcity at a predictable emission schedule. The resource in Ergo is ERG, and miners consume electricity and create this secure electronic asset.\n\nIn the global economy, gold is produced by miners and sold to various actors. Some gold miners may sell ore/refined products to open markets, create OTC contracts, or sell to the central bank to hold in reserve.\n\nErgo already has pathways to the open market via exchanges. OTC, dark pools and a DEX are developing for private P2P sales. SigmaUSD represents a 3rd option that allows miners access to liquidity, the ability to interact with a central contract or bank while circumventing the open market.\n\nThe economics of mining crypto is similar to the economics of trading. Some miners build long positions. They are project-oriented and find a project they believe in and provide critical network infrastructure, maintenance, and development.\n\nOther miners act as freelancers; they provide critical services to profitable projects. They often do not build reserves and continually liquidate in the open market to cover their production cost."

The base cost of this mode is Equipment and Energy.\n- Price stability assists miners in predicting future costs/revenues. SigmaUSD can serve as a price stabilisation mechanism as miners interact with the contract based on their incentive. Long vs Liquidity.\n- Interacting with this protocol rather than interacting with the open market is beneficial to all parties.\nERGO's premise has always been a PoW system that can operate as a Digital Reserve of Programmable Gold"
