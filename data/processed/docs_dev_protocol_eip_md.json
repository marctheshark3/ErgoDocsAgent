  "summary": "Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are a set of guidelines and standards designed for the continuous improvement of Ergo, covering core protocol specifications, client APIs, dApp/contract standards, and more. The document outlines several EIPs that have been proposed and implemented, including EIP-0001 (UTXO-Set Scanning Wallet API), EIP-0020 (ErgoPay), EIP-0037 (Tweaking Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm), and EIP-0027 (Emission Retargeting Soft-Fork). The document also provides information on open EIPs, such as EIP-0042 (Multi-Signature Wallet) and EIP-50 (Sigma 6.0), and a hardfork wishlist item related to the limitation of 1 new token per transaction.",

These proposals encompass a wide range of aspects, including but not limited to, core protocol specifications, client APIs, dApp/contract standards, and more.\n\nHere are some of the EIPs that have been proposed and implemented:\n\n- [x] [EIP-0001: UTXO-Set Scanning Wallet API](eip1.md): This EIP focuses on extending the wallet to serve the needs of external applications by providing a flexible scanning interface.\n- [x] [EIP-0020: ErgoPay](eip20.md): An interaction protocol between wallet application and dApp for creating, signing and sending Ergo transactions.\n- [x] [EIP-0037: Tweaking Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm](eip37.md): This EIP proposes changes to make the current difficulty readjustment more reactive and smoother.\n- [x] [EIP-0027: Emission Retargeting Soft-Fork](eip27.md): This EIP proposes an amendment to the emission schedule to ensure the long-term sustainability of the mining protocol.\n\nTo gain a better understanding of the structure and formatting of EIPs, we encourage you to review the existing EIPs on [GitHub](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips) or within [this documentation](https://docs.ergoplatform.com/tags/#eip). This will provide you with a clear picture of the expectations and standards associated with EIPs."
