  "title": "Ergo Headless dApp Framework (HDF)",
  "summary": "The Ergo Headless dApp Framework (HDF) is a Rust framework for building portable and reusable off-chain logic for Ergo dApps, often referred to as \"Headless dApps\". It provides developers with the first portable UTXO-based headless dApp development framework on any blockchain. Headless dApps separate the core dApp logic from the user interface, allowing for portability, reusability, and composability. The HDF aims to enable developers to write off-chain logic once in Rust and target all platforms, provide a simplified development path, offer a standardized interface, abstract UTXO complexity, and facilitate composability. The framework's design aligns with EIP-6, defining protocols, stages, and actions. The document provides instructions for getting started with the HDF, including prerequisites, cloning the repository, exploring examples, following tutorials, and consulting documentation. It also includes links to the GitHub repository, a video introduction, and a series of tutorials for building a headless dApp.",

    {
      "question": "What are the core concepts of the Ergo HDF based on EIP-6?",
      "answer": "The core concepts of the Ergo HDF based on EIP-6 are Protocol, Stage, and Action, which define the smart contract protocol, specific states within the protocol, and the logic for state transitions, respectively."

      "content": "Headless dApps represent a novel approach to dApp development, focusing on creating pure, portable, self-contained logic for interacting with on-chain [smart contract protocols](../scs/smart-contracts-overview.md).\n\nKey characteristics and benefits include:\n\n*   **Separation of Concerns:** They separate the core dApp logic (reading blockchain state, constructing transactions) from the user interface (frontend). The HDF *is* the \"backend\" logic, but without a built-in frontend (hence \"*headless*\").\n*   **Portability:** Because they are self-contained logic (often compiled to WebAssembly or native libraries), headless dApps built with the HDF can run anywhere \u2013 desktop OS, mobile OS, browsers, servers, bots, etc.\n*   **Reusability & Composability:** They expose a streamlined interface, allowing various frontends (websites, mobile apps, CLI tools) and automated systems (scripts, arbitrage bots) to easily integrate and interact with the underlying protocol without needing deep knowledge of its internal workings. Multiple headless dApps can be composed together within a single application.\n*   **Decentralized Ecosystem:** This model encourages a diverse ecosystem of frontends built by different developers or companies, all leveraging the same core headless dApp logic. This contrasts with the traditional model where the protocol creators often also control the single, primary frontend.\n*   **New Business Models:** It creates opportunities for frontend developers to build value and potentially generate revenue by creating user interfaces for existing headless dApps.\n\nIn essence, headless dApps provide the standardized \"engine\" for interacting with a smart contract protocol, allowing anyone to build the \"car\" (the user interface or application) around it."

Protocols can be single-stage or multi-stage.\n*   **Action:** Defines the logic for state transitions \u2013 how UTXOs move between stages, enter the protocol, or exit the protocol. Actions involve:\n    1.  **Acquiring Inputs:** Gathering necessary UTXOs, user inputs, or external data.\n    2.  **Creating Outputs:** Constructing the output UTXOs that represent the new state after the action, embedded within an `UnsignedTx`.\n\nThe HDF provides Rust structs, traits, and utilities to define these stages, actions, input specifications (`BoxSpec`), and transaction-building logic."
