  "title": "EIP-0009 Hard-fork Activation Protocol",
  "summary": "This EIP specifies a hard-fork activation protocol for the Ergo blockchain, using the transition from Ergo Protocol v1 (EP1) to Ergo Protocol v2 (EP2) as an example. The hard-fork activation process consists of two phases: the first phase collects votes, selects the starting block for the hard-fork, and performs a safe switch, while the second phase is dedicated to code cleanup and optimizations enabled by the hard-fork. The key changes in EP2 include the switch from AOTC to JITC (Just-In-Time Costing), which requires a hard-fork. The voting process ensures that the majority of nodes have upgraded to the latest version before the hard-fork is activated, and that the AOTC and JITC interpreters produce the same results for all blocks up until the hard-fork block to maintain consensus.",

It is not possible to ensure that JITC always produces the same costs as AOTC by changing CostTable parameters. This is because JITC accurately accumulates the actual operations' cost, whereas AOTC approximates both data sizes and speculates on potential costs in case of branching logic. Please see detailed description of the changes in related [EIP8](https://github.com/ergoplatform/eips/pull/11)."

The full nodes vote for HF by running v4.0.0 release, which behaves as v3.x, but implies voting. Every node can check the voting status using Block Extension section. Once the necessary voting threshold is achieved (`HFVoted` status is reached) in an epoch, we know enough mining nodes upgraded and are running v4.0.0 release. We, therefore, can define the first block of the next epoch as the first hard-forked block. We will refer to it as `HFBlock`."

      "heading": "Example: AOTC to JITC switch",
      "level": 5,
      "content": "It is important to ensure that JITC is functionally equivalent to AOTC for all the blocks in `[1 .. HFBlock-1]` range. Here functional equivalence means that for each script, both AOTC and JITC should evaluate to the same result. This property is necessary to remove the old v3.x ErgoTree interpreter and perform the validation of historical blocks using the JITC interpreter alone. Since the history is immutable, it is enough to check the equivalence by running both v3.x interpreter and JITC on all the blocks up until `HFBlock`.\n\nThus, all v4.0.0 nodes will run JITC interpreter in parallel with AOTC and compare the results. If at any time the script results are different, then AOTC result is used in the consensus and the problematic transaction is logged. In addition, the voting is blocked by the node. If AOTC validates the problematic transaction, it still should be added to the blockchain to support the current consensus among v4.0.0 and older nodes. This will lead to all v4.0.0 nodes stop voting, thus preventing the HF switch.\n\nIf voting is blocked (which is an exceptional case), then a fix in JITC is required, so a new v4.0.1 release should be created, and the HF process should start from scratch.\n\nIf voting is not blocked and `HFVoted` network status is achieved, then the majority of nodes are running the latest v4.x version. In this case, the validation of the first block after `HFVoted` (let's call it `HFVotedBlock`) requires both AOTC and JITC to have strictly the same result. Transactions that invalidate this property should be rejected by all v4.0.0 nodes (which are now the majority). This will ensure that in the block range `[HFVotedBlock .. HFBlock]`, AOTC and JITC are functionally equivalent."

      "content": "When voting is not blocked, `HFVoted` status is achieved, and `HFBlock` is selected, then all the v4.0.0 nodes need to switch from EP1 to EP2 starting from `HFBlock`. This switch is implemented as `if` statements in the block validation code of the v4.0.0 release.\n\nThus, starting from `HFBlock`, EP2 is used for all new block validation, and EP1 is turned off (the code is not executed), and the network is operating according to a new consensus (Ergo Protocol v2)."

      "heading": "Example: AOTC to JITC switch",

      "content": "Now, because the v2 consensus is based on JITC, there is an opportunity to fix bugs and add new features to ErgoTree, which are all enabled starting from `HFBlock`. NOTE, both fixes and new features should keep backward compatibility of applications in mind.\n\nThe fixes in JITC for v2 protocol, however, may be not compatible with v1 protocol. This will require JITC interpreter to have an internal branching logic having both versions of the protocol. Thus, JITC v4.0.0 will process historical blocks according to Ergo Protocol v1 and starting from `HFBlock` as Ergo Protocol v2. This will ensure that each v4.x release will successfully validate all historical blocks."
