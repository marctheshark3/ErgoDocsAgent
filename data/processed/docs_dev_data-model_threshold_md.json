  "title": "Threshold Signatures in Ergo",
  "summary": "The document provides an overview of threshold signatures in the Ergo blockchain. Threshold signatures are a cryptographic mechanism that allows a subset of a group to collectively sign a transaction, providing enhanced security and distributed trust. Key characteristics include distributed signing, flexible thresholds, and multi-party computation. The document includes detailed examples, practical use cases, and implementation techniques using Ergo's Sigma protocol framework. Related cryptographic concepts such as Sigma protocols, discrete logarithm proofs, and ring signatures are also discussed.",
