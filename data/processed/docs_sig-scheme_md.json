This document outlines the internal workings of these signature schemes, focusing on the algorithms, protocols, and their implementation within the Ergo ecosystem, particularly within the [`sigmastate-interpreter`](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter) and [`sigma-rust`](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust) repositories."

This is crucial for preventing unauthorized spending of funds and ensuring the security of smart contracts. Ergo uses several cryptographic protocols to achieve this, including Schnorr signatures and Sigma protocols.\n\nThe implementation of these cryptographic protocols is spread across two main repositories:\n\n- [`sigmastate-interpreter`](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter): Focuses on Scala-based ErgoTree interpretation and verification.\n- [`sigma-rust`](https://github.com/ergoplatform/sigma-rust): Provides a Rust-based implementation of the cryptographic primitives, enabling WASM and other Rust-native applications."
