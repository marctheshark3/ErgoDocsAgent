  "title": "ErgoAuth: user authentication protocol between wallet applications and dApps",
  "summary": "ErgoAuth is a user authentication protocol that allows wallet applications to authenticate users to dApps in a trustless manner. The protocol involves the dApp generating a unique signing message and SigmaBoolean that the user must authenticate for, which the wallet app then signs and sends back to the dApp for validation. This allows dApps to verify user access privileges without requiring the user to send tokens to a depositary address. The protocol supports cold wallet integration and provides benefits for dApps by enabling trustless user authentication. The document outlines the data formats, implementation details, and examples of the ErgoAuth protocol.",

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the ErgoAuth protocol?",
      "answer": "ErgoAuth is a user authentication protocol between wallet applications and dApps to validate if dApp users are really who they pretend to be, especially for dApps that grant certain abilities to holders of special tokens."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key steps in the ErgoAuth authentication protocol?",
      "answer": "1) The dApp prepares a unique message and a SigmaBoolean that the user needs to authenticate for. 2) The dApp presents an ErgoAuth link or QR code for the user to open in the wallet app. 3) The wallet app obtains the ErgoAuthRequest data and presents it to the user. 4) The user agrees to authenticate, and the wallet app adds its own bytes to the request and signs it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the benefits of the ErgoAuth protocol for dApps?",
      "answer": "ErgoAuth allows dApps to authenticate users without requiring them to send their tokens to a depositary address, which can be undesirable, especially for valuable tokens. It provides a trustless way for dApps to validate user access privileges without the user having to move their funds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does ErgoAuth support cold wallet integration?",
      "answer": "A future enhancement of ErgoAuth could allow the authentication request to be relayed to a cold wallet device, which would be an enhancement of EIP-0019 and would not change the ErgoAuth protocol."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key data formats defined in the ErgoAuth protocol?",
      "answer": "The key data format is the ErgoAuthRequest, which contains the information needed for the wallet app to authenticate the user."

      "content": "dApps might want to validate if dApp users are really who they pretend to be. This is especially\nuseful for dApps that grant certain abilities to holders of special tokens. At the moment,\nproving that a user owns a token can only be done by sending the token to a depositary address.\nBy sending the token, the user proofed to have access privileges to the token.\nHowever, sending token around is not always desirable. Especially for valuable tokens, users might\nnot want to send it away, and doing two transactions (one to send it to the depositary address, one\nto refund it back) costs both time and transaction fees.\n\nTo overcome this, ErgoAuth proposes a way to authenticate users trustless to have access to certain\naddresses storing a box. The protocol is trustless in both ways: The users don't need to trust\nthe dApp, because the dApp does not get access to funds or secrets. The dApp don't need to trust\nthe users or the wallet app, because it can validate the authentication keys."

      "heading": "ErgoAuth authentication protocol",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "An authentication with ErgoAuth is driven by a dApp that needs to authenticate a user.\n\n1) The user enters the necessary information in the dApp's UI for the dApp to know if authentication\nis necessary. For example, users might enter their P2PK address (or, instead of manually entering,\nuse ErgoPay to send the address to the dApp automatically).\n\n2) The dApp determines that authenticating the user is needed. For this, the dApp prepares a unique\nmessage that the wallet app should sign with a user's private key, and a SigmaBoolean that the user\nneeds to authenticate for. This might be a P2PK address wrapped in a SigmaBoolean.\n\n3) The dApp presents an ErgoAuth link for the user to click and open the wallet app and a QR code\nfor mobile users to scan from within the wallet app.\n\n4) The wallet application parses the QR code/link data and obtains a\n`ErgoAuthRequestUrl` to fetch the actual `ErgoAuthRequest` data from\n(see [Data Formats](#data-formats) section).\n\n5) When `ErgoAuthRequest` is obtained, the wallet presents a screen showing that a dApp wants to\nauthenticate the user, and the address the request is for. The wallet app should also inform the\nuser that no funds or moved and no secrets will leave the device.\nIn a future enhancement, the Auth Request could be relayed to a Cold wallet device. This is an enhancement \nof EIP-0019 and would not change ErgoAuth protocol.\n\n6) When the user agrees, the wallet app adds some own bytes to the obtained message from ErgoAuthRequest,\nsigns it  and sends the signed message to the ErgoAuthRequest's replyToUrl. The added bytes include\nthe host address the authentication request was fetched from, added right after the message defined\nby the dApp. This way, dApp can check if a user authenticated via the right domain and there is no\nmiddleman. \n\n8) The dApp validates the signed message. When successful, it can proceed with its flow."

If the signingMessage contains 0-byte character (unicode 0000), \nthe part of the signingMessage before this sign is interpreted as the user prompt what he is going to sign for\nand must be shown to the user.\n\nIf provided, the wallet application should show the **userMessage** and display the **messageSeverity**\nin a suitable way. It should also show the replyToUrl's hostname so that the user knows to where \nthe authentication is sent. The replyToUrl's hostname must be the same as the one the request was\nfetched from - a wallet application should verify that.\n\nAfter signing is performed, the\nwallet must POST the following data to the dApp using **replyToUrl** from the\nrequest (json format).\n\n```\nErgoAuthResponse:\n  - signedMessage: String\n  - proof: String (Base64)\n```\n\n`signedMessage`: Message containing the `signingMessage` sent by the dApp with additional bytes added by the \nwallet. The addition of random bytes is done to prevent letting the user signing a message that might be used\nfor unwanted malicious tasks. Besides random based, the signed message must also contain the replyToUrl's \nhostname right after the original signing message. This way, the dApp can check if an authentication was done by\nthe user for that dApp, or if another middleman reuses an authentication.\n\n`proof`: Output of signing `signedMessage`\n\nIn case there was an error building the ErgoAuthRequest on the dApp side, the dApp might reply\nwith an `ErgoAuthRequestError` to inform the user about the error:\n\n```\nErgoAuthRequestError:\n  - userMessage: String\n```\n\nThe wallet application will show the user message to the user."
