  "summary": "The document describes the configuration options for a node in a blockchain network. It covers settings for the state type, extra index, transaction verification, block management, mining, offline generation, state snapshots, and chain update delay. The key points include the ability to choose between a UTXO or digest state type, optional extra indexing of transactions and addresses, verification of transactions, control over the number of blocks to keep, mining configuration options, and settings related to state management and chain synchronization.",

    {
      "question": "What are the possible options for the `stateType` setting?",
      "answer": "The possible options for `stateType` are `utxo` and `digest`."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the `extraIndex` setting?",
      "answer": "The `extraIndex` setting allows the node to store all transactions, boxes, and addresses in an index."
    },

      "question": "What is the purpose of the `verifyTransactions` setting?",
      "answer": "If `verifyTransactions` is set to true, the node will download block transactions and verify them."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the `blocksToKeep` setting?",
      "answer": "The `blocksToKeep` setting defines the number of last blocks to keep with transactions and ADproofs, while only storing the header for other blocks."

      "answer": "The `extraCacheSize` setting sets the number of recently used extra indexes kept in memory."

      "heading": "State Type",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "```conf\nstateType = \"utxo\"\n```\nThe `stateType` setting sets the type of state the node maintains. Possible options are `utxo`, where the node keeps a full utxo set allowing it to validate arbitrary blocks and generate ADProofs, and `digest`, where the node only keeps the state root hash and validates transactions via ADProofs."

      "level": 2,
      "content": "```conf\nextraIndex = false\nextraCacheSize = 500\n```\nThe `extraIndex` setting, if set to true, allows the node to store all transactions, boxes, and addresses in an index. `extraCacheSize` sets the number of recently used extra indexes kept in memory."

      "heading": "Verify Transactions",
      "level": 2,

      "level": 2,
      "content": "```conf\nblocksToKeep = -1\n```\nThe `blocksToKeep` setting defines the number of last blocks to keep with transactions and ADproofs. Only the header will be stored for other blocks."

      "heading": "Offline Generation",

      "level": 2,
      "content": "```conf\nacceptableChainUpdateDelay = 30m\n```\nThe `acceptableChainUpdateDelay` setting is the acceptable difference between the current time and the timestamp of the latest chain update or best block. It helps to discover syncing issues."

      "heading": "Memory Pool Configuration",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "The mempool settings define the maximum number of unconfirmed transactions the node will accept, the interval for re-checking a transaction in the memory pool, the mempool transaction sorting scheme, the number of transactions to rebroadcast at each epoch, and the minimum fee amount for transactions."
