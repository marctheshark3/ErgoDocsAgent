  "summary": "EIP-0025 proposes a URI scheme for initiating Ergo payments, similar to BIP-0021 for Bitcoin. The purpose is to enable users to easily make payments by clicking links on webpages or in emails. The URI contains the address, amount, label, description, and token details, allowing the wallet to fill the payment form. The wallet should process the URI as long as it can parse and interpret the content unambiguously, and display any implicit actions to the user. The document provides examples of valid URIs and guidelines for wallet implementation.",

      "content": "> \ud83d\udd17 From [EIP-0025](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ergoplatform/eips/master/eip-0025.md)\n\n\n* Author: MrStahlfelge\n* Created: 14-Dec-2021\n* License: CC0\n* Forking: not needed\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nLike [BIP-0021](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki) for Bitcoin, this EIP proposes a URI scheme for initiating payments.\n\nThe purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to easily make payments by simply clicking links on webpages or in e-mails.\n\nIn difference to Ergo Pay (EIP-0020), this URI scheme does not contain a prepared transaction that the wallet should sign or discard. Instead, it contains \nthe data that the wallet application should use to fill its payment form. The user can change the details when needed. The wallet will build the transaction, \nso this scheme is easier to handle on static websites or in e-mails.\n\n\nFormat\n------\n\n    ergourn        = \"ergo:\" ergoaddress [ \"?\" ergoparams ]\n    ergoaddress    = *base58\n    ergoparams     = ergoparam [ \"&\" ergoparams ]\n    ergoparam      = [ amountparam / labelparam / messageparam / tokenparam ]\n    amountparam    = \"amount=\" *digit [ \".\" *digit ]\n    labelparam     = \"label=\" *qchar\n    messageparam   = \"description=\" *qchar\n    tokenparam     = \"token-\" qchar *qchar \"=\" *digit [ \".\" *digit ]\n\n\n* label: Label for that address (e.g. name of receiver)\n* address: ergo P2PK or P2S address\n* description: message that describes the transaction to the user"

    {
      "heading": "Amount",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "If an amount is provided, it MUST be specified in decimal ERG. All amounts MUST contain no commas and use a period (.) as the separating character to separate \nwhole numbers and decimal fractions. I.e. amount=50.00 or amount=50 is treated as 50 ERG, and amount=50,000.00 is invalid."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Tokens",
      "level": 3,
      "content": "If a token parameter is provided, it specifies the token id and the desired amount separated by an equals sign. The amount must be specified in decimal token \nvalue, for example \"3.45\" for 3.45 SigUSD. The amount MUST contain no commas and use a period (.) as the separating character to separate whole numbers and decimal fractions.\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n     ergoplatform:9ewA9T53dy5qvAkcR5jVCtbaDW2XgWzbLPs5H4uCJJavmA4fzDx\n\n     ergoplatform:9ewA9T53dy5qvAkcR5jVCtbaDW2XgWzbLPs5H4uCJJavmA4fzDx?amount=1.0&description=Hard%20work\nrequests 1 ERG for hard work\n\n     ergoplatform:9ewA9T53dy5qvAkcR5jVCtbaDW2XgWzbLPs5H4uCJJavmA4fzDx?token-03faf2cb329f2e90d6d23b58d91bbb6c046aa143261cc21f52fbe2824bfcbf04=5\nrequests 5 SigUSD\n\nIn the case of sending token only, a minimum amount of ERGs MUST also be sent to a new box (it is not possible to create boxes containing tokens only with zero ERGs).\n\nThe wallet should process the URI as long as it can parse and interpret the content unambiguously. Any ambiguity should be detected and if it cannot be resolved, the wallet should give a descriptive message to the user (not just \"Invalid URI\", but what exactly has been detected as invalid).\n\nAt the same time the wallet should not do anything implicitly, even if it is smart enough to so some implicit actions, it should display what is going on to the user on the transaction sending screen. The user should be aware that some implicit action where taken by wallet and that those actions will take effect when the Send button is pressed.\n\nApplying the above principles to the missing ERGs amount parameter problem we can see that it can be automatically resolved by the wallet, so the wallet shouldn't reject the URI as invalid when the amount of ERGs is missing. At the same time, the screen should have an explanation that non-zero amount of ERGs in the field is required and that it was suggested by the wallet.\n\nFor the case of duplicate tokens, the wallet CAN consider such URI as invalid, and clearly communicate the problem to the user so that the user can take a screenshot and send it back to the dApp developer. The duplication problem should be clear from the screenshot."
