  "summary": "The document provides an overview of the voting configuration settings in the system, which allow nodes to propose changes to the network or vote on existing proposals, including soft-forks or the deactivation of specific rules. It explains how to configure the \"rulesToDisable\" array to propose the deactivation of specific rules, and how to vote on soft-forks by increasing the \"protocolVersion\" and setting specific values for the proposed changes. The voting configurations enable flexible network changes to adapt the blockchain's operation over time.",

    {
      "question": "How can a node vote on a soft-fork proposal?",
      "answer": "To propose or vote on a soft-fork, the 'protocolVersion' must be increased by one in a block header. The node will then automatically propose a soft-fork (at the beginning of an epoch) or vote for it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can a node vote against a proposed change?",
      "answer": "To vote against a proposed change, the node can set the value for the change's ID to zero in the 'voting' configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'voting' configurations?",
      "answer": "The 'voting' configurations allow for flexible network changes, promoting adaptability in the blockchain's operation as conditions or requirements change over time."

      "content": "```bash\n\"rulesToDisable\" = []\n```\nThis configuration allows specifying an array of rule identifiers that you would like to propose for deactivation with a soft-fork. If you are not proposing any rules for deactivation, this can be left as an empty array.\n\nFor example, if you want to propose the deactivation of the storage fee factor, you would list its ID here."

      "heading": "Voting on Soft-Fork",
      "level": 2,
      "content": "To propose or vote on a soft-fork, the `protocolVersion` must be increased by one in a block header. Once this is done, the node will automatically propose a soft-fork (at the beginning of an epoch) or vote for it.\n\nAs an example, suppose you want to vote on changing the target value for storage fee factor (ID: 1) to 1000000, you would use the following configuration:\n\n```bash\n1 = 1000000\n```\n\nSetting any non-zero value will vote for the soft-fork, while setting it to zero votes against it. For instance, to vote against a proposed change with ID 120, you would set:\n\n```bash\n120 = 0\n```\n\nThe `voting` configurations allow for flexible network changes, promoting adaptability in the blockchain's operation as conditions or requirements change over time."
