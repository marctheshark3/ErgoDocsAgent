This feature eliminates the need for self-custody, offering peace of mind to users.\n\n2. **Reversible Address**: Moria Finance implements a reversible address design, where the user's public key is combined with a trusted third party's public key and the Moria Finance platform's public key. This design ensures that funds can only be accessed with the consent of all parties involved, providing an additional layer of security and trust.\n\n3. **Multisig Management**: Moria Finance offers an easy-to-use multisig interface for managing corporate funds. The multisig server is implemented using Supabase Realtime, enabling companies to require signatures from multiple authorized parties before executing transactions, ensuring proper oversight and governance."
