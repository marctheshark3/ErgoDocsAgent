  "summary": "This document provides instructions for building the Ergo Node from source code. It covers the prerequisites, including Git, Java Development Kit (JDK), and SBT (Scala Build Tool), and the step-by-step build process. The guide explains how to clone the Ergo repository, optionally check out a specific version, handle SNAPSHOT dependencies, compile the JAR file, and locate the generated JAR. It also mentions an alternative Docker-based build process and a link to the manual setup guide for further instructions after building the node.",

      "content": "1.  **Clone Repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo.git\n    ```\n2.  **Navigate to Directory:**\n    ```bash\n    cd ergo\n    ```\n3.  **Checkout Specific Version (Optional):**\n    *   To build the absolute latest development code (potentially unstable), stay on the default branch (`master`).\n    *   To build a specific release or release candidate (RC), check out the corresponding tag using `git checkout <tag_name>`. Find tags on the [releases page](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases/).\n        ```bash\n        # Example for a specific release\n        git checkout v5.0.10 \n        \n        # Example for a Release Candidate\n        git checkout v6.0.0-RC2 \n        ```\n4.  **Handle SNAPSHOT Dependencies (If Applicable):**\n    *   Some development versions, especially **Release Candidates**, may depend on unreleased `SNAPSHOT` versions of libraries (like `sigmastate-interpreter`). If the next step fails due to missing SNAPSHOT dependencies, you **must** build and publish these dependencies locally first.\n    *   **See the dedicated guide: [Handling SNAPSHOT Dependencies](snapshot-dependencies.md)**\n5.  **Compile the JAR:**\n    *   Run the SBT `assembly` task. This compiles the code and packages the node and all its dependencies into a single executable JAR file.\n        ```bash\n        sbt assembly\n        ```\n    *   The resulting JAR file will be located in the `target/scala-*/` directory within the `ergo` project folder (e.g., `target/scala-2.13/ergo-*.jar`). The exact name will include the version number.\n6.  **Locate the JAR:** Find the generated `ergo-*.jar` file in the `target/scala-*/` directory. You can now move this JAR file to your desired node installation folder (e.g., the `ergo` folder created in the [Manual Setup guide](manual.md))."
