    "question": "What is the purpose of the hybrid costing model introduced in Ergo Protocol Reference Client 5.0.0?",
    "answer": "The hybrid costing model enhances the network's user experience by allowing more efficient transaction processing within blocks, benefiting miners, developers, and users."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two stages of the hybrid costing model?",
    "answer": "The hybrid costing model operates in two stages: 1) Reduction Stage (JIT Costing) and 2) Cryptographic Verification Stage (AOT Costing)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Reduction Stage (JIT Costing)?",
    "answer": "In the Reduction Stage, the cost of reducing each input's guarding script to its final sigma proposition is calculated using Just-In-Time (JIT) costing, meaning the cost is determined based on the actual operations performed during reduction."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the Cryptographic Verification Stage (AOT Costing)?",
    "answer": "In the Cryptographic Verification Stage, the cost of verifying the required cryptographic proofs (e.g., signature checks) is calculated using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) costing, which is simple, fast, and predictable."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the significance of scalability and costing in the cryptocurrency space?",
    "answer": "For a blockchain technology to achieve long-term viability and widespread adoption, adaptability and scalability are crucial. Costing refers to the computational expense associated with validating transactions and smart contracts, which is an important factor in the network's performance and scalability."
