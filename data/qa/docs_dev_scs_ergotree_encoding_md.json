    "question": "What is the purpose of ErgoTree encoding?",
    "answer": "ErgoTree encoding is a binary formatting system designed for the storage, transfer, and cross-platform operation of ErgoTree contracts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Variable Length Quantity (VLQ) encoding and how is it used in ErgoTree encoding?",
    "answer": "VLQ encoding is an effective scheme that accommodates integer representation using a variable number of bytes. ErgoTree encoding applies VLQ encoding for integer representation."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the `putULong` method in the Scala code encode a long value using VLQ encoding?",
    "answer": "The `putULong` method encodes a long value by iteratively analyzing the input value and writing the encoded bytes to a buffer array using VLQ encoding."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is ZigZag encoding and how does it help in encoding signed 64-bit integers in ErgoTree?",
    "answer": "ZigZag encoding converts signed integers into unsigned integers suitable for efficient VLQ/varint encoding, allowing for more efficient encoding of signed 64-bit integers."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does the `encodeZigZag64` method in the Java code demonstrate ZigZag encoding?",
    "answer": "The `encodeZigZag64` method shifts the long integer 'n' one bit to the left and performs a bitwise XOR operation with 'n' shifted arithmetically 63 bits to the right, effectively converting the signed integer to an unsigned integer."
