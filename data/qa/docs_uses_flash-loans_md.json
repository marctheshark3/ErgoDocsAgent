  {
    "question": "How does the deterministic nature of the UTXO model present challenges for the implementation of dynamic flash loans?",
    "answer": "Predicting the final state of all affected UTXOs in real-time DeFi markets can be challenging, as the UTXO model operates on a deterministic framework."

  {
    "question": "What is the Ergo community's perspective on the absence of Atomic Chained Transactions (ACTs) in their blockchain model?",
    "answer": "The Ergo community has discussed the absence of ACTs, which would support only static outcomes and limit the dynamic nature of flash loans, but also offer the advantage of mitigating some of the associated risks."

  {
    "question": "Is the challenge of implementing flash loans in the UTXO model an insurmountable obstacle?",
    "answer": "The deterministic nature of UTXO blockchains presents intriguing challenges for inherently dynamic flash loans, but it is not necessarily an insurmountable obstacle."
