    "question": "What is the purpose of external tools and simulators for ErgoScript debugging?",
    "answer": "External tools and off-chain simulators play a vital role in testing and understanding ErgoScript contract behavior in a controlled environment, given the limitations of direct on-chain debugging."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Spectrum Finance ErgoScript Simulator?",
    "answer": "The Spectrum Finance ErgoScript Simulator is a community-developed tool specifically designed for simulating ErgoScript execution, providing more insight into evaluation steps and intermediate results than simple unit tests."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the potential features of the Fleet SDK Playground or REPL?",
    "answer": "The Fleet SDK ecosystem may include online playgrounds or command-line REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tools that allow developers to quickly test small ErgoScript fragments, context construction, or serialization/deserialization logic."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is escript.online?",
    "answer": "escript.online is an online editor and compiler for ErgoScript, useful for writing scripts, checking syntax, and seeing the compiled ErgoTree output."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key benefits of using external tools and simulators for ErgoScript debugging?",
    "answer": "External tools and simulators allow developers to execute ErgoScript code off-chain, mimicking the on-chain environment to varying degrees, and provide more insight into the behavior of ErgoScript contracts in a controlled environment."
