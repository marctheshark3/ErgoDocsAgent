    "question": "What is the purpose of ADProofs?",
    "answer": "ADProofs enable efficient and secure validation of transactions for light clients without requiring full blockchain download."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do ADProofs allow for state verification?",
    "answer": "Light clients can use ADProofs to calculate the new state root (a cryptographic summary of the UTXO set) after applying the transactions in a block, allowing them to stay synchronized with the blockchain without storing the complete state."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the security benefit of ADProofs?",
    "answer": "ADProofs are cryptographically secure, ensuring that any tampering with the transactions or the UTXO set will be detected during validation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the structure of ADProofs as defined in the ADProofs.scala class?",
    "answer": "The ADProofs class defines the structure of ADProofs, which contains the following components."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where can the ADProofs.scala file be found?",
    "answer": "The ADProofs.scala file is located at https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/blob/master/ergo-core/src/main/scala/org/ergoplatform/modifiers/history/ADProofs.scala."
