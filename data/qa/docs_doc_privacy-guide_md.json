    "question": "What are the potential risks of the pseudo-anonymity of Bitcoin?",

    "question": "How do the privacy and security trade-offs of centralized and decentralized financial systems differ?",
    "answer": "Traditionally, banks and governments keep their centralized ledgers private, which means one must trust these entities to remain honest and ensure the safety and liquidity of funds. In contrast, the public and pseudonymous nature of the blockchain comes as a double-edged sword, making users vulnerable to attacks, leaks, and other issues."
