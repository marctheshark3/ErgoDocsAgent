    "question": "What is atomic composability in the context of blockchain systems?",
    "answer": "Atomic composability refers to the ability to combine and execute multiple operations or transactions as a single, indivisible unit, where either all components are executed successfully or none of them are executed at all."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is atomic composability crucial for ensuring the integrity and reliability of complex operations in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)?",
    "answer": "Atomic composability is crucial for DeFi applications, such as flash loans and instant arbitrage, which involve multiple interconnected transactions that must execute atomically to prevent partial execution and ensure the integrity of the overall process."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does Ergo address the challenge of balancing scalability and atomic composability in blockchain systems?",
    "answer": "Ergo addresses this challenge by optimizing the use of resources within existing blockchain platforms, rather than relying on unproven technologies, to ensure that atomic composability is preserved while enabling scalability."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the significance of the open-source nature of DeFi in enabling a high degree of composability within the ecosystem?",
    "answer": "The open-source nature of DeFi allows for the integration, modification, and reuse of dApps, enabling a high degree of composability within the ecosystem."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a practical example of a flash loan scenario that requires atomic composability?",
    "answer": "In a flash loan scenario, a user borrows funds from a lending pool, trades those funds on a decentralized exchange (DEX), and then repays the loan with a profit, all within a single transaction. If any part of this process fails, the entire transaction must be reversed to prevent the user from retaining the borrowed funds without repayment."
