    "question": "What is the purpose of the Dust-prevention Fee in Ergo?",
    "answer": "The Dust-prevention Fee is a security measure that requires each box to contain a minimum amount of ERG, determined by a parameter voted on by miners and the size of the box. This helps prevent the creation of dust in Ergo and mitigate potential spam attacks."

  {
    "question": "Can transactions without a fee be included in Ergo blocks?",
    "answer": "Transactions without a fee are less likely to be included in a block by miners, so it is generally recommended to include a fee to incentivize miners to process your transaction."
