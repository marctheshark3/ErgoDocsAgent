    "question": "What are the key constraint areas when developing mobile applications with Scala or other JVM-based libraries?",
    "answer": "The key constraint areas include: 1) Scala version compatibility, ensuring compatibility with the Scala version used by the Ergo libraries, and 2) JDK version requirements, ensuring the JDK version used for compilation and Android compatibility."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the considerations around Scala version compatibility when using Ergo's core libraries?",
    "answer": "Ergo's core libraries have migrated to Scala 3, so developers need to ensure their build tools (SBT, Gradle) and dependencies are compatible with the Scala 3 version. They also need to be mindful of potential binary incompatibilities between different Scala minor versions, especially across major releases (2.x vs. 3.x)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the JDK version requirements for compiling Scala code and dependencies?",
    "answer": "The JDK version used to compile Scala code and dependencies often requires JDK 11 or higher. Developers also need to ensure the JDK used by their Android build process is compatible with both Android and the required JDK level for their Scala dependencies."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the importance of ensuring the correct JDK version is used for Android projects?",
    "answer": "Android projects have specific JDK compatibility requirements that might differ from the developer's desktop development environment. Ensuring the JDK used by the Android build process is compatible with both Android and the required JDK level for the Scala dependencies is crucial."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the potential issues that can arise from binary incompatibilities between different Scala minor versions?",
    "answer": "Developers need to be mindful of potential binary incompatibilities between different Scala minor versions, especially across major releases (2.x vs. 3.x), which can cause compatibility issues when using Ergo's core libraries."
