    "question": "How does the 'change' level differ between BIP-0044 and EIP-0003?",
    "answer": "In BIP-0044, the constant 0 is used for external addresses and constant 1 for internal/change addresses. EIP-0003 does not use constant 1 at all, and all wallets should have any change within a transaction go back to the address using constant 0."

    "question": "How can you derive an address using the Ergo node's wallet API?",
