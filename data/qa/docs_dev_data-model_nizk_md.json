    "question": "What are Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKs)?",
    "answer": "NIZKs are advanced cryptographic techniques that allow one party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself, and without requiring real-time interaction between the prover and verifier."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the theoretical foundation of NIZKs in Ergo?",
    "answer": "NIZKs in Ergo are primarily implemented through Sigma Protocols (\u03a3-protocols), which provide a powerful and flexible approach to zero-knowledge proofs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the key characteristics of NIZKs?",
    "answer": "Key characteristics of NIZKs are: 1) Non-Interactive - Proofs can be verified without direct communication, 2) Zero-Knowledge - No information about the secret is revealed, and 3) Composable - Can be combined using logical operators like AND, OR, and THRESHOLD."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do NIZKs reduce computational overhead and network complexity?",
    "answer": "Unlike traditional interactive zero-knowledge proofs, NIZKs can be verified asynchronously, which reduces computational overhead and network complexity."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do NIZKs support advanced smart contract logic and privacy-preserving protocols?",
    "answer": "The composability of NIZKs enables the creation of complex cryptographic conditions, which supports advanced smart contract logic and privacy-preserving protocols."
