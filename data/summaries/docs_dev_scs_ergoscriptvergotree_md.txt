ErgoScript is a high-level, developer-friendly language for writing smart contracts that are then compiled to ErgoTree before being written to the Ergo blockchain. ErgoTree is a low-level, tree-based language that the Ergo node understands, but is difficult to write directly. ErgoTree programs are deterministic and consist of a sequence of boolean predicates joined using AND and OR. The Ergo node executes the ErgoTree program contained in a transaction and considers it valid if it evaluates to true. An example ErgoTree program can be expressed more concisely in ErgoScript.
