This document provides a tutorial on how to use the Nautilus wallet and sigma-rust library to perform message signing and user authentication for Ergo blockchain applications. It demonstrates how to sign a message with the user's wallet address and then verify the signature on the server-side using sigma-rust. The document also discusses security considerations, such as implementing an expiration mechanism for signed messages and checking the user's token balance on every request to ensure they still own the required NFT. The tutorial is aimed at developers who want to build Ergo-based applications that require secure user authentication and access control.
