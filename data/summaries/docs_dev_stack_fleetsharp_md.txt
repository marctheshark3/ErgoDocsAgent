FleetSharp is a C# library for building transactions on the Ergo blockchain, inspired by the TypeScript fleet-sdk. The document provides several examples of using FleetSharp, including sending simple ERG-only transactions, sending transactions with tokens, minting tokens, and interacting with a contract by ensuring input selection and setting registers. The examples demonstrate the key functionality of the library, such as creating transactions, signing transactions, and submitting transactions to the Ergo network.
