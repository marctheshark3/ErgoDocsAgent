ErgoAuth is a user authentication protocol that allows wallet applications to authenticate users to dApps in a trustless manner. The protocol involves the dApp generating a unique signing message and SigmaBoolean that the user must authenticate for, which the wallet app then signs and sends back to the dApp for validation. This allows dApps to verify user access privileges without requiring the user to send tokens to a depositary address. The protocol supports cold wallet integration and provides benefits for dApps by enabling trustless user authentication. The document outlines the data formats, implementation details, and examples of the ErgoAuth protocol.
