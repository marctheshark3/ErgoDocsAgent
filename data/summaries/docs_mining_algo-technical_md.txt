Autolykos is a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm used in blockchain mining. It is based on the Equihash paper and the generalized birthday problem. The algorithm requires a large cyclic group G of prime order q with a fixed generator g and identity element e. Miners must find k (=32) elements from a set of N elements that yield a hash value lower than a target value. The block mining procedure involves inputting the block height h and upcoming block header hash m, then generating a list R of numeric hashes r using the Blake2b256 hash function. The algorithm then computes a list A from R and checks if the sum of k elements from A has a hash value lower than the target. The first miner to solve this puzzle can add the next block to the blockchain.
