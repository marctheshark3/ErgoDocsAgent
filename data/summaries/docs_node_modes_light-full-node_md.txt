The light full-node mode in Ergo allows for a more resource-efficient way of running a node while still maintaining full-node security. It only holds the root digest of the dictionary and checks full blocks or a suffix of the blockchain. The light full-node mode supports wallet functionalities and custom scans but can only accept and broadcast transactions initiated within its own network. To run the node in light mode, specific settings need to be adjusted in the ergo.conf file, including the state type, blocks to keep, and bootstrapping options. The light full-node mode requires less memory, disk space, and CPU compared to an archive node, but users should verify compatibility with their desired wallet implementation.
