The document provides an overview of the Merkle Tree format used in the Ergo blockchain. It explains the structure of the Merkle Tree, including leaf nodes, internal nodes, and the Merkle Root. The leaf nodes represent transaction hashes and spending proofs, while internal nodes are constructed by hashing the concatenation of their child nodes. The Merkle Root serves as a cryptographic commitment to the entire dataset. The document also covers the encoding of Merkle proofs, which allow efficient verification of data integrity. It includes references to the relevant code implementations in the Ergo and Scrypto repositories.
