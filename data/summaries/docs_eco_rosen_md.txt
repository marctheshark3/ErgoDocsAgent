Rosen Bridge is an open-source protocol that enables secure and efficient cross-chain asset transfers, primarily focused on Ergo. It eliminates the need for smart contracts on the bridged chains by using a system of Watchers and Guards to achieve consensus on the Ergo platform. The bridge has several key features, including scalability, user safety, and the use of the RSN token for sybil resistance, fee distribution, and service access. The bridge is expected to launch imminently and has plans to add support for additional blockchains like BTC, BSC, and Dogecoin in the future. The team includes 8 developers with some frontend and UI tasks outsourced.
