The document outlines a proposed upgrade to Oracle Pool version 1.0, addressing perceived limitations such as excessive dust generation, inadequate reward provision, and non-transferability of Oracle tokens. The key features of Oracle Pool version 2.0 include a single pool address, an epoch counter, a compact pool box dissociated from pool management logic, a refresh box for data collection, reward tokens instead of Ergs, no separate funding process, and reward accumulation to avoid dust. The upgrade aims to mitigate the issues in the previous version and provide a more efficient and user-friendly Oracle Pool system.
