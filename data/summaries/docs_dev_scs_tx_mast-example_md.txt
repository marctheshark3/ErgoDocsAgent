The document provides a tutorial on Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) in Ergo, a technique used to improve privacy and efficiency for complex smart contracts with multiple spending conditions. It explains how MAST works, the benefits it provides, and how it compares to traditional script execution. The tutorial includes an example of implementing MAST in ErgoScript, demonstrating the on-chain logic for verifying the Merkle proof and executing the appropriate spending condition. The document also outlines the practical implementation steps for setting up MAST off-chain, including defining the spending conditions, compiling them to ErgoTree bytes, and building the Merkle tree.
