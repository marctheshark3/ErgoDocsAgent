This document provides an overview of the current best practices and available tools for debugging ErgoScript, the smart contract language used in the Ergo blockchain. It emphasizes the importance of thorough off-chain testing and careful contract design, as on-chain debugging is limited. The document discusses current mechanisms like the experimental `debug()` function and transaction failure analysis, as well as external tools such as the Spectrum Finance ErgoScript Simulator, Fleet SDK Playground, and escript.online. The document also outlines future desired features, including execution traces, improved debug output channels, and enhanced simulator capabilities. Overall, the document highlights the challenges of debugging smart contracts on the blockchain and the need for robust off-chain testing and verification.
