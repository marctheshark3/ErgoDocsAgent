The document discusses a decentralized token sale scenario where the seller provides buyback guarantees. The buyback contract has an expiration condition and allows the original seller to request the tokens back. The sell contract is defined to handle the buyback process, including checking the buyback script hash, the buyback amount, and the seller's proposition bytes. The document also mentions the concept of "smart orders" where DEX orders can be enhanced with complex logic such as token-sale and liquidity providing.
