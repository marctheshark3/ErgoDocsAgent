This document provides a comprehensive overview of building off-chain services for Ergo dApps. It discusses the importance of off-chain components in bridging the gap between the user and the blockchain, enabling functionalities such as user interfaces, complex transaction construction, state management, event monitoring, data indexing, wallet interaction, automation, and external integrations. The document outlines common off-chain patterns, including watchers/monitors, bots/agents, backend APIs for dApps, and indexer services. It provides code examples using the Fleet SDK to illustrate these patterns and highlights real-world examples from the Ergo ecosystem. The document emphasizes the need for secure key management, robust logic, and efficient blockchain data processing in the development of these off-chain services.
