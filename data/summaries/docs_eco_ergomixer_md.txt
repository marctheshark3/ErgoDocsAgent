ErgoMixer is the first non-custodial, programmable, non-interactive mixer in the space, utilizing Ergo's Sigma protocols to enable efficient, trustless mixing of funds, providing a high degree of privacy and security. It features token mixing, covert addresses, stealth addresses, SigmaUSD minting, and Tor support. ErgoMixer introduces two privacy-centric features: Covert Addresses, which allow users to showcase a public-facing address that doesn't directly tie back to their actual wallet address, and Stealth Addresses, which create a unique, one-time address for every transaction, making it nearly impossible to link transactions to each other or to the original published address.
