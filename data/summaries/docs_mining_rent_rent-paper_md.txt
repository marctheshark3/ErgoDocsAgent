This article builds upon research on a multi-dimensional approach to cryptocurrency fees. It discusses the challenges of blockchain storage, including the risk of centralization, vulnerability to spam attacks, resource drain, and deflationary pressures. The paper introduces a 3-dimensional scale to assess fees based on space, duration, and computational load, using case studies of Bitcoin and Ethereum to illustrate these concerns. The paper suggests "storage rent" as a solution, a recurring fee on Unspent Transaction Outputs to deter indefinite data storage and promote a more efficient, secure, and sustainable blockchain system. The paper's key contributions include considering fee complexity in multiple dimensions, highlighting the unsustainability of unchecked state growth, introducing innovative fee algorithms, advocating for strategic state management, and exploring the unintended ripple effects. The article also discusses miner costs and the need for a multi-dimensional fee structure in platforms like Ethereum to account for storage load, computational load, and network load, using the Ergo blockchain's "state deterioration fee" as an example.
