Ergo transactions represent atomic state transition operations that destroy existing boxes and generate new ones. Each transaction comprises input boxes, output boxes, and optional data-input boxes. Data inputs allow multiple transactions to reference the same UTXO without consuming it, reducing transaction fees and addressing limitations of traditional UTXO-based blockchains. Transactions must provide proof of spending correctness, and they are publicly viewable. Ergo provides tools like a transaction builder to compose and sign transactions, and also supports chained transactions that spend outputs of off-chain transactions.
