This document aims to address common misconceptions about the Ergo blockchain. It clarifies that the emission process is controlled by a transparent smart contract, and developers cannot arbitrarily extract coins. It also dispels the myth that all Ergs were pre-mined. The document explains that Ergo prohibits out-of-thin-air emission in the coinbase transaction, and the EFYT token was not a traditional ICO. It discusses how miners will continue to be incentivized after emissions end, through transaction fees, Miner Extracted Value, and storage rent. The document also addresses misconceptions about ASICs and FPGAs, stating that there are currently no serious ASIC efforts, and FPGAs have had minimal impact on Ergo mining due to practical limitations.
