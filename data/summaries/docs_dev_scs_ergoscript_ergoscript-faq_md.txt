Ergo uses [Coll] instead of an Array to maintain a one-to-one correspondence between ErgoScript and Scala, as Arrays in Scala are mutable while all elements in ErgoScript are immutable. The term "Coll" was chosen over other options like "Collection[Int]" and "Seq" during the design discussions in 2018-2019, as they were either visually unappealing or did not align with the principles of ErgoScript.
