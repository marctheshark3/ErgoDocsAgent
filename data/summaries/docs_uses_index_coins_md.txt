Index Coins are a type of cryptocurrency that allow investors to gain exposure to a basket of different cryptocurrencies. Dynamic market-making algorithms are necessary to adjust the funds after price changes. The creators of index tokens must have market knowledge to decide which tokens to include and in what proportions. Examples of index coins running on Ethereum include ASSY, YETI, PIPT, and YLA, issued by the Powerpool Protocol.
