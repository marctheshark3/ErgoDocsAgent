Grand Gambit is the pioneering casino on the Ergo blockchain, offering a variety of games that can be played using ERG and other tokens. The platform is open-source, has undergone security review, and operates with a small fee structure to cover costs and further development. While not a decentralized application, Grand Gambit aims to provide a flexible gaming experience, allowing users to analyze winnings and losses to verify fairness. The platform is compatible with desktop and Android mobile devices, but the iOS Terminus wallet is currently not supported.
