The document discusses "Mining in Logarithmic Space", which refers to the use of Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) to enable light clients to operate in an online mode. This approach allows the compilation of unnecessary parts of the blockchain data into the blockchain itself, eliminating the need for new miners to carry historical data. As light miners continue to mine, they assist other light miners in bootstrapping. This makes the entire miner population abandon old blocks, enhancing the system's efficiency. The protocol achieves "always secure", "always succinct", and "online" NIPoPoWs, which are necessary components for a logarithmic space mining scheme. The document also provides an overview of how NIPoPoWs can be integrated into PoW consensus models like Ergo and Bitcoin to reduce historical data storage, and explains the implementation of NIPoPoWs through superblock clients.
