Ergo's Storage Rent System is a key strategy implemented to ensure the long-term economic sustainability of the Ergo blockchain. It is an 'on-chain garbage collection' mechanism that mitigates blockchain bloat and turns it into a profitable venture for miners. Storage rent is a minimal fee levied on unspent outputs (UTXOs) or 'boxes' after a period of four years of inactivity, with the fee per byte determined by the storage rent subprotocol. This amounts to approximately 0.14 ERG every four years for a typical box. The document also provides a link to a detailed guide on Ergo's storage rent system and how to consolidate a wallet.
