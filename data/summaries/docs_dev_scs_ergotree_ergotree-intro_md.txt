ErgoTree is the typed abstract syntax used to define logical propositions protecting boxes in the Ergo blockchain. Serialized ErgoTree expressions are written into UTXO boxes and evaluated by the transaction verifier. Most Ergo users develop contracts in a higher-level language like ErgoScript, which is then compiled into ErgoTree. The design of ErgoTree aims to provide a robust platform for contractual money by ensuring deterministic contract execution and facilitating spam-resistance. Specifically, ErgoTree avoids non-deterministic operations to guarantee consistent execution, and it is designed to defend against attacks that could overload network nodes.
