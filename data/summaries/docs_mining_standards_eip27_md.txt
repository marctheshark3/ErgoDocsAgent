Ergo is a Proof of Work blockchain with a defined emission schedule for the release of ERG tokens. The original emission schedule was set to be completed within eight years with a total supply of 97,739,925 ERG. Recently, the Ergo Foundation proposed EIP27 to extend the emission schedule by approximately 17.38 years to ensure the long-term sustainability of the mining protocol. The proposal was approved by the mining community with over 90% of the votes. The new emission rules will integrate with the original schedule, where block rewards are reduced every three months by 3 ERG/block. Once implemented, a portion of the block rewards will be sent to a remission contract that will release block rewards until approximately 2045.
