Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) allows users to verify payments without running a full Bitcoin node, by keeping a copy of the block headers and querying network nodes to obtain the Merkle branch linking their transaction to the block. However, SPV is vulnerable to attacks where an attacker overpowers the network and deceives SPV users. While SPV is intended for resource-limited devices, it may not be feasible for Ethereum due to the large size of the headers. Ergo implements Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) to enable highly efficient 'Light SPV' mobile wallets that only need to download a small sample of block headers.
