Smart Contracts: ErgoScript is the smart contract language used by the Ergo blockchain. While it has concise syntax, it may seem unclear at first because it is conceptually different from conventional languages. Ergo is a UTXO-based blockchain, whereas smart contracts are traditionally associated with account-based systems like Ethereum. However, Ergo's transaction model has many advantages over the account-based model, and developing Ergo contracts can be significantly easier than writing and debugging Solidity code.

The key aspects that make the Ergo contract model different are: 1) Paradigm - Ergo's UTXO-based programming model is declarative, unlike Ethereum's imperative account model. 2) Scalability - Ergo transactions are created off-chain, and only validation checks are performed on-chain, reducing the number of operations performed by every node. 3) Shared state - Ergo's model is based on an immutable graph of transactions, unlike Ethereum's shared mutable state. 4) Expressive Power - Ergo extends UTXO to enable Turing completeness while limiting the complexity of the ErgoScript language itself.
