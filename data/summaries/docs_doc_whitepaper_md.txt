- Use of ErgoScript, a powerful scripting language based on Î£-protocols, to encode conditions for spending coins.
- Extended support for light nodes to allow running contracts on untrusted commodity hardware.
- A survivability approach using widely-researched solutions to prevent security issues and performance degradation over time.
- A self-amendable protocol to absorb new ideas and improve itself in the future.
- Autolykos, a unique Proof-of-Work consensus protocol that is both memory-hard and pool-resistant.
- A long-term focus on decentralization, serving regular people, and enabling contractual money applications.
