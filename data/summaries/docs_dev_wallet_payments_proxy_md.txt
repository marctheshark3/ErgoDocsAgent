Proxy contracts are a smart contract pattern used on Ergo for secure dApp interactions. They act as intermediaries, allowing users to interact with dApps in a controlled and secure manner. The concept gained prominence with tools like the Ergo Assembler, enabling early dApps to function effectively. Proxy contracts provide a secure "spending script" that users can send funds to, which then interacts with the target dApp based on predefined rules. The design of proxy contracts has evolved to address potential vulnerabilities, with key principles being fund safety and dApp integrity. For detailed technical specifications, refer to the Ergo Improvement Proposal EIP-0017: Proxy Contracts.
