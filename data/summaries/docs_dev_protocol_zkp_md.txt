The document discusses zero-knowledge proofs and Sigma protocols, which are crucial for maintaining secrets in cryptography. Sigma protocols, such as proof of discrete log and proof of Diffie-Hellman tuple, are efficient and composable proofs that enable powerful use cases when combined with a blockchain. Ergo provides access to these discrete log-based zero-knowledge proofs and allows for trustless coin or custom token swaps across blockchains. The document emphasizes the importance of optional privacy, where privacy remains an option for individuals to protect their personal boundaries. Ergo prioritizes a rich smart-contract language, and non-optional privacy would make powerful contracts infeasible. The document suggests that in the future, the Ergo community could enable privacy by default or integrate mix-nets and other novel ideas on the application layer.
