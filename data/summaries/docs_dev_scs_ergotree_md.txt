ErgoTree is the typed abstract syntax of the ErgoTree language used for defining logical propositions that protect boxes (coin abstractions) in the Ergo blockchain. It serves as a specialized language that directly interacts with key components such as Boxes, Tokens, and Zero-Knowledge Sigma-Propositions. ErgoTree is optimized for efficient storage and rapid execution, and it is essential for creating, securing, and managing boxes on the Ergo blockchain. ErgoTree is structured as a typed abstract syntax tree and functions as an authentication language, verifying specific conditions through secret data predicates and blockchain context predicates. ErgoTree's versatility extends its applicability to various digital platforms, including other cryptocurrencies and Central Bank Digital Currencies. The document provides additional resources and key concepts related to ErgoTree.
