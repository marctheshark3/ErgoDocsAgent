Monster Pub Brawl is a gaming dApp that revolves around the scarcity of alcohol, a rare resource that can enhance the power of monsters. The game features an annual Monster Pub Crawl where contestants compete in a series of battles across regions to acquire glory, booze, and a spot in the inner circle. The raw materials to produce alcohol are found in extremely hostile territories, and only skilled alchemists can distill them into a potable concoction.
