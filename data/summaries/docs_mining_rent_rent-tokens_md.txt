Ergo's storage rent mechanism allows miners to take over valuable assets inside a UTXO if there are insufficient ERGs to pay rent. This mechanism incentivizes miners by offering them additional rewards, but it also poses risks for users who are unaware of the system or fail to maintain enough ERG. A proposed EIP-33 to address these concerns is under discussion, but there is currently no consensus.
