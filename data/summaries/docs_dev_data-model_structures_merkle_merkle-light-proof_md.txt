The document provides an example of how a lite client, such as a decentralized pool, can verify that a specific transaction is included in a block using a Merkle proof. It outlines the steps involved, including transaction creation, the mining process, the components of the share submitted by the miner, and the verification process by the pool. The example code demonstrates how to verify the transaction inclusion using the Merkle proof, and the document explains the key elements of the code. The approach allows lightweight clients to efficiently validate transactions without downloading the entire blockchain, reducing the computational burden and ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain.
