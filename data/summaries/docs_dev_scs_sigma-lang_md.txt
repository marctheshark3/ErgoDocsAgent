The 'Sigma Language' is a family of Sigma-protocol based authentication languages that generalize the Bitcoin Script language. The Sigma Language, implemented through the ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree interpreter, allows developers to specify coin spending conditions. ErgoTree is a bytecode language that defines guarding propositions for coins as logic formulas combining predicates over a context and cryptographic statements provable via Î£-protocols.
