This document provides instructions on how to sign transactions using a backend wallet in the context of Ergo. It covers two common use cases: an NFT vending machine and an off-chain bot that withdraws funds from contracts. The document outlines the necessary code snippets and emphasizes the importance of avoiding storing the seed phrase in the code, instead recommending the use of a secret manager. It also provides additional references to the sigma-rust library, the sigma-rust Discord channel, and the dAppstep repository for further information on using the backend wallet for transaction signing.
