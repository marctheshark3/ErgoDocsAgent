This document provides examples of how to write tests for Merkle Batch Proofs using both Rust (sigma-rust) and Scala (scrypto) libraries. The tests cover the creation, verification, serialization, and deserialization of batch Merkle proofs. The Rust tests use the sigma-rust library, while the Scala tests use the scrypto library. The tests ensure the correctness of Merkle Batch Proof implementation in the Ergo blockchain.
