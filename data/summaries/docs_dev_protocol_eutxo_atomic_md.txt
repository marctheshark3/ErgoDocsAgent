Atomic Swaps are a revolutionary technology that enables direct interaction between different blockchain systems, facilitating the transfer of digital assets across chains without the need for centralized exchanges. The document explains how atomic swaps work, with a step-by-step overview of the process. It also highlights the advantages of the Ergo blockchain in implementing atomic swaps, particularly its eUTXO model that allows for partial order fulfillment, enabling a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) supporting cross-chain trading. The document includes a Python-based illustration of an atomic swap scenario between two parties, Alice and Bob, using the secp256k1 elliptic curve.
