Soft Forks in Ergo are backward-compatible protocol updates that introduce new rules or deactivate existing ones without requiring a hard fork. The soft-fork process is governed by a strict voting mechanism involving miners and spanning multiple epochs. Key stages include proposal, voting, activation, and implementation. Soft forks allow the Ergo network to evolve while maintaining compatibility with non-upgraded nodes. The process has specific preconditions, voting rules, and technical details around block generation, validation, and fork ordering logic. Examples are provided to illustrate the voting process and activation.
