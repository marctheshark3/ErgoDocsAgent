Hodlbox is a platform designed to encourage long-term holding of Ergo (ERG) by allowing users to purchase "treasure chests" with varying locking options. Users can lock 10 to 10,000 ERG for either two years or until the value of ERG reaches $20. As a reward, users receive NFTs corresponding to the amount they lock, which serve as a visual representation of their commitment to the Ergo ecosystem. The potential returns on investment can be significant, with locked amounts potentially yielding $2,000 to $200,000 when ERG reaches an all-time high of $20. The project aims to foster community engagement and collaboration within the Ergo ecosystem.
