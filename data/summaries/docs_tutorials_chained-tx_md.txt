This document provides a tutorial on sending chained transactions on the Ergo blockchain using the ergpy library in Python. It covers the following key points:

1. Establishing a connection to the Ergo blockchain by setting the node URL.
2. Defining the wallet mnemonic and receiver addresses for the transactions.
3. Creating an output box for the initial "genesis" transaction.
4. Submitting a sequence of chained transactions, where each transaction spends the output of the previous one.
5. Handling the input boxes and output boxes for the chained transactions.
6. Incorporating a delay between submitting the transactions to the blockchain.
