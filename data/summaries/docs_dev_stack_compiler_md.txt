The ErgoScript Compiler is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to compile ErgoScript code into an Ergo address. It provides a step-by-step guide for setting up and compiling ErgoScript code, including instructions for compiling from source or using a precompiled JAR file. The tool also supports integrating the ErgoScript Compiler into your project by adding a dependency to your build.sbt file. Additionally, the tool can generate payment requests by replacing register values from human-understandable forms to serialized-hex needed by the Ergo client's REST API.
