This document provides an overview of blocks in the Ergo blockchain. It explains that blocks are fundamental units of data that group together transactions, forming a secure and transparent record of all transactions on the blockchain. Ergo uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, where miners solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain. The document outlines the structure of Ergo blocks, which include a header, block transactions, ADProofs, and an extension section. This structured approach enhances efficiency and allows for greater flexibility in incorporating new features and upgrades. The document also mentions related concepts such as Ergo modifiers and superblock clients.
