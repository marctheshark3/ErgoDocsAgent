This EIP proposes an auction contract that allows for the decentralized auctioning of any kind of tokens, including artwork, share tokens, and more. The contract supports features such as using any token as the auction currency alongside ERG, a "buy it now" option, precise auction duration based on timestamp, auto-extending the auction duration near the end, minimum bid steps, and royalties for the original token issuer. The contract includes various registers to store information about the auction, such as the seller's and bidder's details, the auction's end time, "buy it now" amount, and other metadata. The contract also includes a configuration box that stores settings like the UI fee, UI implementor's address, maximum miner fee, and auction extension parameters.
