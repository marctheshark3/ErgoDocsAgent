The ErgoScala compiler is a compiler for Ergo smart contracts written in ErgoScala, a subset of Scala. It supports compilation of formally verified smart contracts from the ergo-contracts repository. The compiler produces an ErgoContract that provides an ErgoTree instance, Ergo's IR, and a Scala anonymous function that evaluates the contract code to a sigma property. The document provides examples of how to use the compiler to define a buyer contract and how to compile verified contract code.
