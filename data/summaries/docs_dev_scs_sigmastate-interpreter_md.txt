The Sigmastate Interpreter is a core component of the Ergo platform, providing the implementation of the ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree interpreter. It is responsible for processing and validating ErgoScript contracts, ensuring that transactions comply with the defined cryptographic conditions. The interpreter involves two main components: the Prover, which generates cryptographic proofs for spending conditions, and the Verifier, which checks the validity of these proofs. The Sigmastate Interpreter is integrated into higher-level tools like AppKit and SigmaJS, allowing developers to interact with the core components in their Scala and JavaScript projects.
