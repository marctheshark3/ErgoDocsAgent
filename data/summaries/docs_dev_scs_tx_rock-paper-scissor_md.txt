The document introduces the Rock-Paper-Scissors game as an example of a multi-stage smart contract. The game is played between two players, Alice and Bob, who choose secret moves. To prevent the first player from being disadvantaged, the game uses a commitment scheme where Alice first commits to her move, and then both players reveal their moves. The summary covers the three phases of the game: the Commitment Phase where Alice commits to her move, the Reveal Phase where Bob reveals his move, and the Reveal Phase where Alice reveals her original move and the secret to verify the commitment. The document also discusses the challenge of handling edge cases where a malicious player might refuse to reveal their commitment.
