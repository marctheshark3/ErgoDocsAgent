This document outlines the handshake process in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocol, which is essential for establishing a connection between peers. It covers the format of the handshake message, including peer features, network protocol version, and session information. The document also provides example implementations from the Ergonnection and Ergo Handshake repositories, which demonstrate how to handle the serialization, deserialization, and management of handshake data during the connection establishment process. The handshake procedure involves a peer sending a handshake message, and another peer replying within a specified timeout period.
