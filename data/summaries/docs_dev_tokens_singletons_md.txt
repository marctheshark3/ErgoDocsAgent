In the UTXO model, a singleton token is a token issued with a quantity of exactly one unit. Singleton tokens can be used to emulate long-lived accounts, where a transaction that spends an old box with the singleton token and creates a new one can be controlled by the script of the old box, allowing a smart account marked with the token to exist and alter its state. One specific example of a singleton token is an oracle, such as a token created to act as an ERG/EUR exchange rates oracle, where the box containing the token encodes the exchange rate in a specific register, and contracts can refer to the oracle token identifier beforehand.
