Oracle Core is a crucial off-chain component run by oracles, who form an integral part of an oracle pool. It provides a user-friendly HTTP API interface for reading the current protocol state and submitting data points. The Oracle Core automatically generates the required transaction, posts it, and performs any other necessary actions for the protocol to run smoothly, reducing the workload for the oracle operator. To function correctly, the Oracle Core requires access to a full node wallet. The current Oracle Core is built to run the protocol specified in the EIP-0023 PR, which outlines the proposed upgrade to Oracle Pool version 1.0 with several enhancements. A guide is available for setting up an ERG/XAU oracle pool in a testnet environment.
