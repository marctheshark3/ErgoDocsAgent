This document provides an overview and comparison of different strategies for indexing Ergo blockchain data. It discusses the benefits of indexing, such as improved performance, data aggregation, and reduced node load. The three main approaches covered are using public explorer APIs, querying the node's API directly, and building a custom indexer with SDKs. The choice of strategy depends on the application's specific requirements, such as the need for simple lookups, high query volume, complex queries, aggregated data, and real-time sensitivity. The document also outlines the development effort, infrastructure required, and level of control and trust associated with each approach.
