This document provides a step-by-step tutorial for setting up MiningCore on a Windows 10 machine. The key steps include:

1. Install PostgreSQL 10 or the latest version.
2. Launch the pSQL Shell and log in using the credentials set during PostgreSQL installation.
3. Create a database role and schema for MiningCore.
4. Run the necessary database setup scripts.
5. Create a partition of the shares table for each coin you set up.
6. Configure the pool by creating a coin-specific JSON config file.
7. Create a startup batch file to launch the MiningCore pool.

The tutorial ensures the pool is set up and ready to go, with a note to ensure the coin's node is fully synced before launching the pool.
