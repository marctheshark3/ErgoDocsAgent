Mining Pools are groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of finding a block, with the reward split among the pool members proportionally. While larger pools win blocks more frequently, long-term earnings are roughly the same regardless of pool size. Dual mining allows mining Ergo alongside other coins. Solo mining is an option for those who wish to operate independently. Several mining pools offer a solo port. Resources and a list of popular Ergo mining pools are provided. SmartPools are a decentralized alternative to traditional mining pools, using autonomous on-chain smart contracts.
