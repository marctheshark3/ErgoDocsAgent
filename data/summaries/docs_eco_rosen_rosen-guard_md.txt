The Rosen Guards are a federated group of entities responsible for the security maintenance and execution of responses for the Rosen bridge. They monitor network activities, process reported events, and execute required actions. Guards lock RSN tokens as collateral, and funds are emitted or slashed based on their behavior. Becoming a Guard is an effort-intensive and permission-based process. The Rosen Bridge Guard Service facilitates transaction submissions across different blockchains by processing events, reaching consensus on transactions, and interacting with the target blockchain using multi-signature and threshold signature schemes to ensure security and trustworthiness.
