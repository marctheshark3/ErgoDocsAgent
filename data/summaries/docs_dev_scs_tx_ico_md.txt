The document provides a detailed overview of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) contract on the Ergo blockchain. It covers the three main stages of an ICO: Funding, Issuance, and Withdrawal. The Funding stage involves creating a box guarded by a script that manages an authenticated data structure (AVL tree) to store investor data. The Issuance stage transitions the contract to the Withdrawal stage, updating the AVL tree flags and verifying the token issuance. The Withdrawal stage allows investors to withdraw their allocated ICO tokens, using AVL tree proofs to authenticate and remove their entries from the dictionary. The document also includes a summary of a Refundable ICO contract used by the Comet project.
