Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS) are innovative mutual credit associations that enable communities to create their own local currencies, fostering sustainable economies independent of traditional monetary systems. LETS allow participants to exchange goods and services using locally-created credit, enhancing the velocity of trade within the community. LETS have historically emerged as a solution during economic crises, providing a lifeline for communities facing economic hardship. A blockchain-based LETS could offer a more secure, transparent, and scalable solution, enabling interoperability between different LETS, increased resilience, and innovative financial products. Ergo's blockchain can be used to implement a Trustless LETS system without the need for centralized control.
