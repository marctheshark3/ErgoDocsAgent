ErgoNation is a community-driven project focused on decentralized identity (Î£ID) verification on the Ergo blockchain. It aims to implement the "one person, one vote" concept in an anonymous and decentralized manner within the Ergo community. Participants create an Ergo wallet, use ErgoMixer to maintain anonymity, and complete monthly identity verification events to receive a verification code. ErgoNation has no token, treasury, or centralized team, and is dependent on voluntary independent contributors. The project encourages upholding the ideals of crypto, decentralization, and anonymity.
