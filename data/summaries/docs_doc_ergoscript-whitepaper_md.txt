ErgoScript is a new cryptocurrency scripting language designed to be friendly to cryptographic protocols and applications. It is more powerful than Bitcoin Script, but does not have unbounded looping or recursion, allowing for efficient processing. ErgoScript incorporates non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs called Sigma-protocols as first-class primitives, enabling developers to create sophisticated scripts that can prove various properties without revealing sensitive information. The language also allows for predicates over the blockchain state and transaction details, enabling self-replicating and Turing-complete long-term script behavior. ErgoScript is a statically typed functional language with support for common operations and data structures.
