The document discusses the concept of merged mining on the Ergo blockchain, particularly in the context of the Sigma Chains framework. Merged mining allows miners to simultaneously mine multiple blockchains using the same hashing power, which is proposed as a key consensus mechanism for Ergo's pegged sidechains. The mechanism involves representing the sidechain's state and progress as a data tuple, which is submitted to the Ergo mainchain via a dedicated UTXO protected by a smart contract. This approach provides flexibility, leverages Ergo's expressive smart contracts, and enables efficient and trustless cross-chain interoperability. The document also highlights the advantages of this merged mining approach on Ergo, such as its ability to revitalize Proof-of-Work, support various mining algorithms, and provide sustainable economic incentives for miners.
