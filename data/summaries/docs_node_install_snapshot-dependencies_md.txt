This document provides guidance on handling SNAPSHOT dependencies when building the Ergo node from source code. It explains what SNAPSHOT versions are, why they can cause build issues, and the steps to resolve the problem. The key steps include: 1) Identifying the required SNAPSHOT dependency, 2) Cloning the dependency repository, 3) Checking out the correct commit/branch, and 4) Publishing the dependency locally using `sbt publishLocal`. This allows the Ergo node build process to find the required SNAPSHOT dependency and successfully complete the build.
