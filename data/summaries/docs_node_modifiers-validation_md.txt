This document outlines the consensus-critical validation rules that every node in the Ergo network should perform. The rules cover various aspects of transaction validation, such as the minimum number of inputs and outputs, the maximum number of inputs and data inputs, the requirement for non-negative output values, and the constraint on the sum of output values. The document also mentions that some rules may be disabled later through miner voting via soft forks, and new rules may be added as well. The rules are initially all activated, and those that cannot lead to money printing and are not enforced by serializers may be disabled later.
