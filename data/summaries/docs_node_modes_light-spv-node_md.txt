The document introduces the concept of Light-SPV Mode, which allows for simplified payment verification (SPV) on the Ergo blockchain. Ergo implements Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NIPoPoWs) to enhance the efficiency of SPV wallets, enabling them to download a small sample of block headers (around 250) rather than the entire blockchain. This makes it possible for users with limited resources to participate in the network and make transactions without needing a full node. The document also mentions that Ergo is currently developing a highly efficient Ergo wallet with SPV security.
