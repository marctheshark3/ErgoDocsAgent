The document describes SigmaRand, a secure random number generation service for the Ergo blockchain. It outlines the challenges of generating randomness on a blockchain and proposes the Commit-Reveal protocol as a solution. The Commit-Reveal protocol involves a two-phase process where participants first commit to a random seed value, then reveal it, ensuring that the final random number is equally determined by all participants. The document provides a detailed implementation of the protocol for Ergo, including example transactions and workflows, and references the ergo-randgen GitHub repository for further information.
