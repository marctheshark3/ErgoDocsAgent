This document outlines the key build constraints and compatibility issues that developers should be aware of when building mobile applications (Android/iOS) that incorporate Scala or other JVM-based libraries. It covers areas such as Scala version compatibility, JDK version requirements, Android SDK levels and API compatibility, code shrinking and obfuscation (R8/ProGuard), and limitations for running JVM code on iOS. The document provides recommendations and resources to help navigate these complexities, emphasizing the importance of starting with a minimal setup, carefully reviewing dependency requirements, and seeking community support when encountering build-related issues.
