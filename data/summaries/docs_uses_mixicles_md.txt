Mixicles are a type of smart contract that uses data from an oracle to create a private contract between two or more parties. They are designed for situations where privacy is important and the contract terms are based on external data. Mixicles work by using oracle data to automatically trigger and enforce the contract terms, eliminating the need for intermediaries. One potential use case is in supply chain management, where a mixicle could be used to create a private contract between a company and a supplier based on data about raw material quality and delivery. Overall, mixicles offer a way to establish trusted, private contracts using external data sources without the need for third-party oversight.
