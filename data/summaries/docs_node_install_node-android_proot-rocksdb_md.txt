This guide details the process of running an Ergo node on an Android device using an Arch Linux environment within Termux via proot. This method is necessary if you need to run the node with stateType="utxo" (which uses RocksDB for state storage) or if you encounter database issues with the direct Termux setup. The guide covers the prerequisites, installation of proot-distro and Arch Linux, and the steps to log into the Arch environment and run the Ergo node.
