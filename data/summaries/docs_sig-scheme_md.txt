This document provides an in-depth look at the signature schemes used in the Ergo blockchain. It outlines the internal workings of these signature schemes, focusing on the algorithms, protocols, and their implementation within the Ergo ecosystem. The document covers Schnorr signatures, Sigma protocols, and their integration with ErgoTree, Ergo's smart contract framework. It highlights the security, efficiency, and simplicity of Schnorr signatures, as well as the role of Sigma protocols in Ergo's privacy-preserving features and complex smart contracts. The implementation details are discussed across the `sigmastate-interpreter` and `sigma-rust` repositories.
