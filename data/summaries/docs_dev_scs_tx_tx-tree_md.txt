A transaction tree represents a sequence of related transactions hierarchically, where each transaction can have one or more child transactions dependent on its successful execution. This creates a branching structure resembling a tree, with the initial transaction at the root and subsequent transactions forming the branches. Transaction trees are useful for representing complex transaction sequences and dependencies, especially within smart contracts and advanced blockchain applications. They allow for conditional logic and simple loops to be implemented within the transaction scripts, determining which branch of the tree is followed. The Ergo blockchain's eUTXO model supports the creation of such transaction tree structures.
