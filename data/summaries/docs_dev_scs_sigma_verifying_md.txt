Schnorr Signatures is a key cryptographic primitive in Ergo, allowing for efficient, simple, and secure signatures. Ergo uses the Secp256k1 elliptic curve for its Schnorr signature scheme, which allows a user to prove knowledge of a private key without revealing the key itself. The document explains the Schnorr signing process, the Schnorr identification process, and the Schnorr signature verification process. It also provides an example of on-chain verification of a Schnorr signature in ErgoScript, demonstrating how to reconstruct the commitment U and verify the signature.
