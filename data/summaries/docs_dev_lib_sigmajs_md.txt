Sigma JS is a JavaScript library currently under development and not yet ready for production use. It aims to offer a user experience for JavaScript developers comparable to what AppKit provides for JVM developers, in conjunction with Fleet. The document provides resources to help understand and follow the development of Sigma JS, including a JavaScript module on npmjs and a project called sigmajs-crypto-facade that aims to replace BouncyCastle's elliptic curve dependencies in the Sigma.JS compilation process.
