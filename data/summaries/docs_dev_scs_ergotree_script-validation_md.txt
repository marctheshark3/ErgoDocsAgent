Efficient Script Validation: For a transaction with multiple input boxes, each input box has a script that needs to be executed within the context of the current transaction. To maintain steady block validation of 1000 transactions per second, a simple transaction with a single input box requires validation of 1000 scripts per second.

To minimize block validation time and increase the probability of successful mining, the following steps are performed:
1. Create a Context object with the input box.
2. Traverse the ErgoTree to build a cost graph for cost estimation.
3. Compute the cost estimation by evaluating the cost graph with the current context.
4. If the cost is within the limit, evaluate the ErgoTree using the context to obtain a sigma proposition.
5. Execute the Sigma protocol verification procedure.
