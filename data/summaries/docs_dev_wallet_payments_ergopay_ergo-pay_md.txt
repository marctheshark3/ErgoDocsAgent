ErgoPay is Ergo's dedicated dApp connector for non-web wallet applications, allowing any wallet to connect with any dApp. It has been integrated into Ergo Wallet App 1.6 and a demonstration dApp for minting and burning tokens is available. To use ErgoPay, users need to install Ergo Wallet App 1.6 and visit the demonstration dApp. ErgoPay differs from web dApp connectors in its versatility, as it can connect any wallet with any dApp, but this means that some of the dApp logic must run on a server that can be accessed by the user's wallet applications. The document provides resources for implementing a dApp using ErgoPay.
