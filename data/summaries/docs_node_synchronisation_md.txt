The document discusses the blockchain synchronization process in the Ergo blockchain network. It covers the different states a modifier (block, transaction, etc.) can go through during the synchronization process: Unknown, Requested, Received, Held, and Invalid. The primary goal is to transition modifiers from the Unknown state to the Held state to keep the node's view of the blockchain up-to-date with the network.

The document explains the Inv (inventory) protocol used for communication during synchronization, the headers synchronization process, and the block section synchronization process. It also details the transition from the Requested state to the Received state, and from the Received state to the Held state, including handling invalid modifiers and dealing with delivery timeouts.
