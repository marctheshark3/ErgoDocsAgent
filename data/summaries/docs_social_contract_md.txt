Ergo's Social Contract outlines the key principles that should guide the development and evolution of the Ergo protocol. The main principles are: 1) Prioritizing decentralization and minimizing the influence of any single party; 2) Serving the interests of regular people rather than big parties; 3) Focusing on providing an efficient, secure and easy platform for financial contracts; 4) Aiming for long-term sustainability and resilience; and 5) Maintaining a permissionless and open protocol that does not restrict or discriminate against any usage.
