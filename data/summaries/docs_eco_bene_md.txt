Bene: Fundraising Platform is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ergo blockchain that enables projects to receive funding in exchange for participation tokens. The platform allows project owners to create a box that holds tokens and set a block limit as a deadline. A minimum amount of tokens must be sold before the project can withdraw funds, and users have the option to exchange their tokens back for ERGs if the minimum is not reached. The box is self-replicating, allowing anyone to spend it as long as they re-create it with the same parameters and add ERGs in exchange for tokens. The platform supports six main processes: box creation, token acquisition, refund tokens, withdraw ERGs, withdraw unsold tokens, and add tokens. The current implementation supports creating new projects and contributing to projects, and a more advanced implementation could include support for other assets beyond ERG.
