SigmaFi is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) lending through a bond market. It allows Ergo wallet holders to request loans, specifying the amount, term, and interest rate, with the loans being secured by collateral. The platform utilizes the extended unspent transaction output (eUTXO) model to create these loans, and all contracts are open-source, providing a foundation for developers to build upon. SigmaFi exemplifies DeFi by facilitating direct lending between individuals without the need for intermediaries. The platform offers various real-world financial instruments and agreements, encouraging developers to learn from and enhance DeFi applications in the Ergo ecosystem.
