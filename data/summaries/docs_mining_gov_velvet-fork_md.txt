Velvet Forks is a novel approach for introducing protocol changes in a backward-compatible and inclusive manner. The key idea is to render modifications to the protocol backward-compatible, enabling a gradual deployment without harming miners who have not upgraded to the new rules. Velvet forks are a special form of protocol update where the new set of reducing protocol rules is conditionally applied only when the considered elements are valid under the new rules. The key advantages of velvet forks are inclusive deployment, backward compatibility, and gradual adoption. While velvet forks present a promising approach, further research is needed to understand the security implications and impact on the game-theoretic incentives of the underlying blockchain.
