The document discusses the concept of atomic composability in blockchain systems, particularly in the context of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It highlights the importance of atomic composability for ensuring the integrity and reliability of complex operations, such as flash loans and instant arbitrage. The document explores how Ergo's eUTXO model and ErgoScript smart contract language enable the atomic execution of multi-stage transactions. It also discusses the impact of scaling solutions, such as sharding and layer 2 solutions, on atomic composability, emphasizing the need to preserve this crucial feature while achieving scalability. The document suggests that concepts like Asynchronous Contract Execution (ACE) could further enhance the execution of complex and composable smart contracts on blockchain platforms.
