The document introduces the concept of 'boxes' and 'registers' in the Ergo blockchain. Boxes are similar to UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) in other cryptocurrencies, but they can also contain additional data in the form of 'registers'. This makes Ergo's boxes more flexible and functional than traditional UTXOs, enabling more complex operations such as running scripts or smart contracts directly on the blockchain. The document also highlights the differences between Ergo's boxes and the UTXOs used in other UTXO-based cryptocurrencies.
