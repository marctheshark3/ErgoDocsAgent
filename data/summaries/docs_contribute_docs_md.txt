This document provides guidelines for contributing to the documentation. It outlines the prerequisites, the two ways to contribute (minor and major changes), and the guidelines for writing style, code style, and commit messages. The document encourages contributors to have a GitHub account and Python 3.7 or higher installed. For minor changes, contributors can edit the page directly on GitHub and open a pull request. For major changes, contributors need to set up a local development environment, make changes, and submit a pull request.
