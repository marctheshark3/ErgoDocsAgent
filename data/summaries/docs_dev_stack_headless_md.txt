The Ergo Headless dApp Framework (HDF) is a Rust framework for building portable and reusable off-chain logic for Ergo dApps, often referred to as "Headless dApps". It provides developers with the first portable UTXO-based headless dApp development framework on any blockchain. Headless dApps separate the core dApp logic from the user interface, allowing for portability, reusability, and composability. The HDF aims to enable developers to write off-chain logic once in Rust and target all platforms, provide a simplified development path, offer a standardized interface, abstract UTXO complexity, and facilitate composability. The framework's design aligns with EIP-6, defining protocols, stages, and actions. The document provides instructions for getting started with the HDF, including prerequisites, cloning the repository, exploring examples, following tutorials, and consulting documentation. It also includes links to the GitHub repository, a video introduction, and a series of tutorials for building a headless dApp.
