LETS-2: Zero sum, no collateral - Requires a non-refundable joining fee, with zero sum LETS balances.

LETS-3: Positive sum, with collateral - Requires a time-locked joining fee, has positive sum LETS balances, and uses ergs collateral.

LETS-4: Positive sum, no collateral - Requires a non-refundable joining fee and has positive sum LETS balances.

The document also mentions the possibility of a more advanced variant allowing multiple senders and receivers in a single transaction.
