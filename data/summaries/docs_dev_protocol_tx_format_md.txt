The document provides an overview of the box format in Ergo's protocol. A box is a fundamental entity that can hold value, tokens, custom data, and scripts. It consists of up to 10 registers, with the first 4 being mandatory. The box serialization format is described, including the structure of the box bytes. A box candidate is a preliminary version of a box used during transaction creation, with a placeholder value in the $R_3$ register. An Ergo transaction consists of inputs, data inputs, and outputs, and the serialization format for transactions is explained. The document also covers how transactions are signed.
