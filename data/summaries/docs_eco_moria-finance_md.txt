Moria Finance is a decentralized fund management platform built on the Ergo blockchain. It aims to incentivize Bitcoin holders to bridge their assets to Ergo in the form of rsBTC (Renominated Smart Bitcoin) by offering advanced features through Ergo's smart contracts. Key features include smart contract wallets with timelock, reversible address, and multisig management capabilities, providing enhanced security and control over funds. Moria Finance leverages the decentralized security of the Ergo blockchain and the federated security of the Rosen Bridge to offer unparalleled protection for user assets. The project is open-source, and the team welcomes community contributions.
