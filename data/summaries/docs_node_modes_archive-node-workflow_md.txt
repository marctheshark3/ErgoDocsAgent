The document outlines the technical workflow for the full archival node mode in Ergo. The key steps are:
1. Send ErgoSyncInfo message to connected peers to get block IDs that are better than the node's best block.
2. Request headers for the received block IDs and apply them to the node's history.
3. Request transaction IDs for the applied headers and fetch the transactions.
4. Apply the transactions to the node's mempool and broadcast the inventory.
5. Apply the block transactions to the node's history and state, generating ADProofs if in full or pruned-full mode.
