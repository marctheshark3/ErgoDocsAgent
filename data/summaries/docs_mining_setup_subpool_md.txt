Subpool is a decentralized mining solution that allows groups of miners to combine their hash rates for quicker mining rewards. It is a feature of SmartPools, a smart contract-based mining pool that ensures all members mine to the same address, eliminating the need for one person to control the funds. The goal of Subpooling and SmartPools is to promote decentralization in mining pools and support small-scale miners. The latest development in this area is the Lithos Protocol, which represents the next generation of SmartPools and further enhances the benefits of Subpooling. This project was developed for ERGOHACK II.
