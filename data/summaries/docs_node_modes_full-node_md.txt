Full-Node Mode refers to two different modes of operation for a node in the Bitcoin network:

1. Full 'Archival' Node Mode: This is the standard mode, similar to a full Bitcoin node.

2. Pruned-Fullnode Mode: Downloads all headers, validates proofs-of-work, and links structures, followed by downloading a UTXO snapshot from peers and the full blocks succeeding it.
