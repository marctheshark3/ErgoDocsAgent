Data Inputs in ErgoScript are a novel feature that enhances the traditional UTXO-based blockchain's functionality. Data inputs allow transactions to reference and read from existing UTXOs without consuming them, overcoming limitations of the classic UTXO model. Key features include non-destructive access and concurrent data access. Benefits include reduced transaction fees, enhanced DeFi applications, and improved scalability and efficiency. Data inputs are used in ErgoScript transactions to access information without modifying the referenced boxes. This represents a significant advancement over traditional UTXO models, facilitating more complex and interactive smart contracts. Best practices include selective use of data inputs, ensuring reliable data sources, and performing validation checks.
