ErgoNames is a decentralized naming system for the Ergo blockchain, allowing users to register human-readable names that can be associated with their Ergo addresses. Key features include registering unique names, associating names with addresses, resolving names to addresses, supporting subnames, and being decentralized and censorship-resistant. The project is actively being developed by the Ergo community, with core components including Ergo contracts, off-chain tools and libraries, and wallet/application integration. ErgoNames aims to improve the usability and adoption of the Ergo ecosystem by providing a user-friendly naming system.
