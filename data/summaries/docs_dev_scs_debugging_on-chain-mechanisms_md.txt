The document discusses the limited on-chain debugging mechanisms available for ErgoScript, the scripting language used in the Ergo blockchain. It covers the experimental `debug()` function, which allows script writers to output information during script evaluation, and the analysis of transaction failure logs to identify the reasons for script execution failures. The document emphasizes that these on-chain mechanisms have limitations compared to traditional debugging approaches and should be used in conjunction with robust off-chain testing and simulation.
