The Digest State feature in the Ergo protocol allows nodes to optimize the storage of blockchain data by pruning or reducing the size of the UTXO set, blocks, and headers, resulting in more efficient storage utilization. This feature enables nodes to selectively retain only the essential data, reducing the storage requirements and improving performance, while still maintaining full-node security guarantees. However, it is important to note that a healthy network requires a sufficient number of full (non-pruning) nodes to maintain the complete history and state of the blockchain.
