Stealth Addresses are a privacy-enhancing feature in the Ergo blockchain that allow recipients to receive funds without revealing their public address. They use a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to create distinct one-time addresses for each transaction, concealing the linkage between transactions and the original public address. The ErgoMixer tool supports the creation and management of Stealth Addresses. Stealth Addresses differ from Covert Addresses in that they generate a unique address for each transaction, providing stronger privacy protections. The document outlines the technical process of Stealth Address generation, Stealth Payment Address creation, payment transactions, and payment discovery, all of which work together to enhance the recipient's privacy.
