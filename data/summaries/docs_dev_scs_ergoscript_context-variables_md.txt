The document discusses the use of context variables in ErgoScript, a programming language used in the Ergo blockchain. It provides an example of using the `HEIGHT` context variable to create a script that becomes "anyone-can-spend" if the blockchain height is less than 4,000,000, and "no-one-can-spend" if the height is equal to or greater than 4,000,000. The document also mentions other context variables available in ErgoScript, such as `OUTPUTS`, `INPUTS`, and `minerPubKey`, which can be used to write more specific and flexible scripts. It refers readers to the ErgoScript language specification for more details on context variables and their usage.
