The document discusses a proposed off-chain transaction assembler service for Ergo dApps. The service aims to bypass the node requirements for dApps by allowing users to deposit their assets to a specified address, and the service will then assemble the necessary transactions on behalf of the dApp. The document outlines the problem, a proposed solution, trust issues, and potential service provider incentives. It also mentions a related tool called "Tx Builder" that can be used to create transactions for Ergo application protocols. The document provides an example script for creating a timestamp using the proposed service.
