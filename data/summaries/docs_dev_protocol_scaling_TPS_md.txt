The document discusses the importance of transaction speed, or Transactions Per Second (TPS), as a crucial performance metric for blockchains. It explains that the primary bottleneck for increasing TPS is the peer-to-peer network layer, and that while measures like supernodes or eliminating mempools could boost TPS, they compromise the decentralization and integrity of the network. The document then provides a comparative analysis of TPS values for several leading blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, and Polkadot. It highlights that Ergo's TPS is approximately 47.5 transactions/second, and that its Extended Unspent Transaction Output (eUTXO) model outperforms the traditional UTXO model in terms of efficiency and flexibility, enabling a broad spectrum of DeFi applications. The primary objective in scaling Ergo is to enhance TPS without compromising the fundamental principles and assurances typically linked with blockchain technology.
