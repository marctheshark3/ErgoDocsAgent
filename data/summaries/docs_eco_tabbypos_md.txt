TabbyPOS is a comprehensive point-of-sale (POS) solution designed for merchants. It offers a merchant dashboard, a customer-facing interface, and a mobile app for remote management. The solution is scalable and supports various hardware devices. TabbyPOS provides security features such as end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and a built-in fraud detection system. While the whitepaper does not explicitly state compliance with regulations, the security features and use of a secure blockchain may contribute to meeting some compliance requirements.
