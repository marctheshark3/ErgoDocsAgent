ErgoPay is a standard for interaction between an online dApp and a wallet app to facilitate the creation, signing, and sending of Ergo transactions. The protocol allows the dApp to provide transaction details to the wallet, which the user can then confirm and sign using their private keys. The wallet can then submit the signed transaction to the blockchain and optionally notify the dApp. The document outlines two options for data formats: 1) the dApp provides a URL request for ErgoPaySigningRequest information, or 2) the dApp provides a URI scheme containing a ReducedTransaction. The document also describes the implementation details for both wallet apps and dApps, as well as the benefits of the protocol for both.
