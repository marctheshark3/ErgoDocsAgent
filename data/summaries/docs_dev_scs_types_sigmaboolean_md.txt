SigmaBoolean is a crucial data type in ErgoScript that represents propositions proven using Sigma protocols. It is derived from the base type ProveDlog and is used by both the prover and the verifier to construct and verify proofs within ErgoScript. SigmaBoolean is an algebraic data type that allows developers to use boolean-like logic when working with Sigma Propositions. It is a recursive data structure, which adds complexity to the parsing process. The document explores the structure of SigmaBoolean, including its node classes and their corresponding OpCodes, and how to serialize SigmaBoolean from a P2PK address. The document also discusses the role of ErgoTree in Ergo transactions, where the serialized SigmaBoolean is prepended with a header byte to create the spending conditions for a box.
