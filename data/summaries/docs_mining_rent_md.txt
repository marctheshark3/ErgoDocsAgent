Ergo's design includes a 'demurrage' or storage rent mechanism that serves as an 'on-chain garbage collection' system. Starting from block 1,051,200 (July 20th, 2023), miners can charge storage rent or fully spend the box if its value doesn't cover the rent. This provides an additional source of rewards for miners and reduces blockchain bloat. The storage fees stimulate coin circulation and deter deflation. The demurrage mechanism also allows miners to claim valuable assets within a UTXO if the ERGs available are insufficient to cover the rent, which applies to various assets like NFTs and stablecoins. Users are advised to thoroughly understand this mechanism and maintain enough ERGs to protect their valuable assets. Tools like TokenJay and Nautilus are available to check the age of boxes and consolidate them when necessary.
