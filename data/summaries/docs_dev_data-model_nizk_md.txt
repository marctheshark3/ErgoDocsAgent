The document provides an overview of Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKs) in the Ergo blockchain. It discusses the theoretical foundation of NIZKs, which are primarily implemented through Sigma Protocols, and their key characteristics such as non-interactivity, zero-knowledge, and composability. The document also covers the cryptographic primitives supported by Ergo, including Discrete Logarithm Proofs and Diffie-Hellman Tuple Proofs. It explains the implementation techniques used, such as the Fiat-Shamir transformation and proof composition, which allows for the creation of complex cryptographic conditions. The document highlights the advanced applications of NIZKs in Ergo, which contribute to the platform's privacy and cryptographic infrastructure.
