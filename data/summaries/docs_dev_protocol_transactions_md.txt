Transactions in Ergo are atomic state transition operations that destroy existing boxes and create new ones. Each transaction consists of input boxes, output boxes, and optional data-input boxes. Input boxes must have a valid guard script, and transactions can include proof of spending correctness. Transactions are publicly viewable and can be manipulated using the Ergo Transaction Builder tool.
