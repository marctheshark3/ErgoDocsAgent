Multi-stage transactions involve multiple steps, where each step is a separate transaction that must be successfully executed to complete a larger objective. They are often used in complex real-world scenarios on the blockchain, such as escrow services, staged payments, or multi-party agreements. A classic example is the pin-lock contract, where multiple layers of validation or condition checks must be met before the final transaction can occur.
