Proxy contracts are a proposed solution to outsource transaction generation to an external service or dApp, addressing issues such as wallet limitations and scaling dApp infrastructure. The document outlines the motivation, background, and structure of proxy contracts, highlighting how they can be designed to prevent dApp developers or attackers from taking advantage of user funds and preserve the integrity of the dApp infrastructure. The proposed contract structure ensures that users receive what they are paying for and prevents attacks like stealing UI fees or preventing user requests from being executed.
