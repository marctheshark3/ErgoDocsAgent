EIP-0005 outlines a standard for serializing contract templates and including metadata to make them reusable across multiple platforms. It aims to provide a way for developers to easily move contract templates between different protocol implementations, applications, and tools. The EIP describes the binary serialization format for contract templates, including fields like name, description, and optional ErgoTree version. It also defines the serialization format for parameters within contract templates. Additionally, the EIP covers the JSON format for contract templates and provides guidance on supporting this EIP in ErgoTree compilers.
