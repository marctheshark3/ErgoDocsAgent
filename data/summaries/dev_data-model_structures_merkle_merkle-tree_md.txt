Merkle Trees are a fundamental data structure in the Ergo blockchain, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data. They play a crucial role in various blockchain operations, from verifying transactions within blocks to securing additional metadata in the Extension Block. Ergo employs a binary structure for its Merkle Trees, with leaf nodes containing hashes of transaction data or proofs, and internal nodes containing hashes of their child nodes. The cryptographic hashes ensure that any alteration in the underlying data is reflected in the Merkle Root, making the tree tamper-evident. Merkle Trees in Ergo are used for the Transaction Merkle Tree, which combines transactions and their corresponding spending proofs, and the Extension Block Merkle Tree, which secures key-value data. Merkle Batch Proofs and State Proofs are advanced applications that leverage Merkle Trees for efficient verification of multiple data elements and state transitions, respectively.
