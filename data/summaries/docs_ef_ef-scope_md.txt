The Ergo Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the adoption and development of the Ergo Platform. Its mission is to ensure organic and non-breaking development, promote open-source and permissive licensing, support privacy and trustless environments, and foster a community-driven ecosystem.

The Foundation's key areas of focus include infrastructure support, education, promotion and outreach, and development. It takes a principled approach to marketing, empowering community-driven initiatives and fostering organic growth. The Foundation's development efforts are primarily focused on areas where there is a demand not met by the community, with the goal of transitioning to a self-sustaining, community-driven ecosystem over time.

The Ergo Foundation provides funding for the development, evolution, and maintenance of various software repositories, categorized as either Development Funding or Maintenance Funding. The Development Funding repositories are the main focus and part of the core ecosystem development roadmap, while the Maintenance Funding repositories are considered deprecated and will receive only bug fixing and minor issue resolution support.
