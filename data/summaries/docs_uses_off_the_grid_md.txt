Off the Grid is a decentralized application (dApp) that builds on the grid trading contract proposed by kushti. It includes an execution bot/batcher for automating order matching without user interaction. The project utilizes a contract that permits spending only if orders are correctly filled or with the order owner's signature, and it employs off-chain bots/batchers to monitor grid orders and match them against other liquidity sources, currently Spectrum Automated Market Makers (AMMs). Off the Grid supports trading of ERG against any token, with profits accumulated in ERGs, and enables grid orders to profit from repeated execution of the same orders, while bot operators benefit from arbitraging the price difference between the liquidity source and grid orders.
