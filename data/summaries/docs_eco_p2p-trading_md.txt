P2P Trading is a method of exchanging cryptocurrencies directly between individuals without a centralized exchange or intermediary. Buyers and sellers connect directly through a marketplace or platform, negotiate the trade terms, and transfer the cryptocurrency between their wallets. Some options for P2P trading on Ergo include TokenJay's open P2P Escrow service, single-tx-swap.com's trustless escrow service, and the upcoming Analog Ergo cross-chain peer-to-peer marketplace.
