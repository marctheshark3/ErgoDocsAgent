Sigma Protocols are a class of cryptographic proof systems that play a central role in the Ergo blockchain. They allow a prover to convince a verifier that they know a value, such as a secret key, without revealing the value itself. Sigma protocols are the foundation for many privacy-preserving and multi-signature functionalities in Ergo.

ErgoScript offers two elementary Sigma protocols: Proof of Knowledge of Discrete Logarithm (Schnorr Signature) and Proof of Equality of Discrete Logarithms (Diffie-Hellman Tuple). These basic protocols can be composed to create more advanced proofs using logical connectives like AND, OR, and THRESHOLD.

The composability of Sigma protocols enables the creation of sophisticated smart contracts and multi-signature schemes, such as Ring Signatures and Threshold Signatures. These constructions allow for flexible and privacy-preserving proofs, particularly useful for multi-party agreements and anonymous transactions.

Key use cases of Sigma protocols in Ergo include Multi-Signature Wallets, Ring Signatures for Privacy, and Threshold Signatures for decentralized control.
