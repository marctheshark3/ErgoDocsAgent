Satergo Offline Vault is an Android application that securely stores encrypted wallet seed phrases and allows users to perform transactions by connecting to a desktop application (Satergo) via Bluetooth. The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to establish a connection and requires user confirmation and password entry to access the seed phrase and sign transactions, ensuring the seed phrase never leaves the mobile device. The application is designed to be more secure than storing the wallet file on the computer, as it eliminates the risk of malware stealing the seed phrase. The app is not intended to be distributed on the Google Play Store, and other wallet programs are welcome to implement support for Satergo Offline Vault. Improvements include automating the APK download process and adding support for multiple wallets and other desktop operating systems.
