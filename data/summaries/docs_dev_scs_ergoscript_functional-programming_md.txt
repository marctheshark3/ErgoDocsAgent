The document discusses the use of functional programming features in ErgoScript, a programming language used in the Ergo blockchain platform. It presents two examples that demonstrate the application of functional programming concepts in ErgoScript.

The first example shows how to create an ErgoScript program that allows a box to be spent only if the spender knows the discrete log of a given elliptic curve point and all input boxes are protected by the same ErgoScript program.

The second example builds upon the first by adding an additional condition that the box can only be spent if the sum of all input values is greater than 1 Erg. It demonstrates how to compute the sum of all inputs using functional programming techniques in ErgoScript.

The document highlights the importance of functional programming in ErgoScript and how it can be used to implement complex conditions for spending boxes on the Ergo blockchain.
