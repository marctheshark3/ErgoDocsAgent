The Sigmanauts Program is a grassroots initiative aimed at empowering individuals to take ownership of the Ergo ecosystem and help shape its future. It offers three categories of participation: Growth, Community, and Creative. Interested individuals go through a formal application process to become Sigmanaut Candidates (SigCANs) and have the opportunity to work with a team, showcase their skills, and make an impact. As SigCANs contribute and demonstrate their abilities, they can progress to become full-fledged Sigmanauts with greater responsibility. The program provides comprehensive training, fosters collaboration and networking, and manages the Sigmanauts Mining Pool. Since its launch, the Sigmanauts Program has achieved several milestones, including the launch of the Sigmanauts website, the Sigmanauts Mining Pool, and the management of the Ergo Foundation Twitter account.
