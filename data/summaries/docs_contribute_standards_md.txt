This document outlines the standards and recommendations for contributing to projects on the Ergo ecosystem. It covers three main areas: identity, development, and community administration. The identity standards focus on password security and multi-factor authentication. The development standards address server configuration, dependency management, secrets management, and code auditing. The community administration standards cover anti-spam/scam protection, reducing friction between chats, boosting engagement, and educating the community. Specific recommendations are provided for implementing these standards, such as using tools like Snyk, Semgrep, OrgRobot, and Wickbot.
