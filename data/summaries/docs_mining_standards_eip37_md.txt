EIP37 proposes changes to Ergo's difficulty adjustment algorithm to make it more stable and responsive. Key changes include: shorter epoch length, dual calculations using both predictive and classic methods, capping predictive difficulty changes, and limiting overall difficulty changes. Simulations show the proposed changes improve algorithm performance. The upgrade requires a hard fork activation between blocks 843,776 and 851,969, with at least 232 votes within the last 256 blocks.
