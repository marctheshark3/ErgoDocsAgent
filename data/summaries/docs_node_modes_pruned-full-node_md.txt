The document introduces a new feature in the Ergo Protocol Reference Client 5.0.13 called "Pruned Full-Node Mode". This mode allows users to achieve full node security on a standard laptop within minutes by bootstrapping using a verified UTXO set snapshot and NiPoPoWS. This addresses the increasing demands for downloading, storing, and processing the entire blockchain. The mode is similar to the "fast-sync" in Geth or Grothendieck and "warp-mode" in Parity, used by Ethereum protocol clients, but with more aggressive optimizations. The document provides instructions on how to enable this mode and notes that the node may not provide detailed progress updates during the UTXO snapshot download phase. It also explains the technical details of the UTXO set authentication using an AVL+ tree.
