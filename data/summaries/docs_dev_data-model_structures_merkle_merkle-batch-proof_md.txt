The document introduces Merkle Batch Proofs, an advanced cryptographic structure used in the Ergo blockchain to efficiently verify the inclusion of multiple data elements within a Merkle tree. It explains the concept of Merkle trees and Merkle proofs, and how Merkle Batch Proofs extend this by allowing the verification of multiple pieces of data simultaneously. The document highlights the benefits of Merkle Batch Proofs, such as improved efficiency, scalability, and reduced storage and bandwidth requirements. It then discusses the use cases of Merkle Batch Proofs in the Ergo ecosystem, particularly in Proof of Proof-of-Work (PoPow) protocols and efficient state verification.
