This document explains how to use code-blocks in ErgoScript, a programming language used in the Ergo blockchain. It demonstrates the syntax for defining immutable variables using the `val` keyword, and explains that ErgoScript does not support mutable variables like `var`. The document also shows how multiple code-blocks can be combined using logical operators like `||`. The key points covered are the use of code-blocks, immutable variables, and combining multiple blocks in ErgoScript.
