The Field is a peer-to-pool pledging protocol where individuals can pledge assets to support participants in competitions. It is designed to be DAO-driven and open-source. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) smart contracts are complete, and the dApp front-end UI is currently functional with minor tweaks and improvements expected soon. Private testing of pools and pledges is underway, and there is an ambitious goal to have an Olympic event next week for Live Beta testing from the community using small amounts. The project has a Discord server where people can learn more and volunteer to help move the project and DAO forward.
