The document discusses context enrichment in Bitcoin and other UTXO-based blockchain systems. It introduces four levels of context, with Level 2 and above being suitable for supporting transaction trees. The document shows how to create efficient Ethereum-like contracts in the UTXO model using transaction trees, with examples including a Rock-Paper-Scissors game, an ICO campaign, and reversible addresses. It also discusses the need for efficient emulation of Turing completeness beyond the use of Rule 110 cellular automation, and how code in context Level 2 and higher can ensure that each stage of a multi-stage protocol is followed.
