Ergo has introduced Oracle Pools V2 to address drawbacks of the initial version, offering features like a single pool address, epoch counter, compact pool box, and token-based rewards. The document provides a comprehensive comparison between Oracle Pools v1.0 and v2.0, highlighting the significant advancements in the latter.
