Machina Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) under development on the Ergo blockchain. Its unique feature is the use of grid order contracts, which have the potential to replace traditional liquidity pools and offer a more decentralized and peer-to-peer trading experience. The primary objective of Machina Finance is to promote decentralization and facilitate peer-to-peer trade, leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a secure, transparent, and user-friendly DEX. The grid order contracts are currently under development and are expected to bring significant changes to the way DEXs operate.
