ErgoUtils now supports obfuscating entry points for ErgoMixer to improve privacy. When withdrawing from the mixer to a wallet, it is obvious that the person has received funds from the mixer. This tool allows creating obfuscating addresses that randomly route the funds through multiple addresses before reaching the user's wallet, making it harder to identify the mixer usage. The document provides an example transaction demonstrating the effectiveness of this feature, which is freely available in the ErgoUtils open-source project.
