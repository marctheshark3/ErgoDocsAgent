Crystal Pool is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ergo blockchain, enabling real-time order-based trading directly on Layer 1. It is designed to provide a user experience comparable to centralized exchanges (CEXs) while maintaining the security and self-custody benefits of a DEX. Key features include a limit order DEX, partial fill, multiple boxes and sellers in one transaction, and multi-token support. Crystal Pool leverages Ergo's smart contract capabilities and the eUTXO model to create a decentralized order book and matching engine directly on the blockchain. It offers real-time trading, security and self-custody, transparency and censorship resistance, and composability with other Ergo-based protocols and applications.
