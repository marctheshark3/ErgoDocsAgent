Ergo is a decentralized blockchain platform that aims to be the central bank digital currency (CBDC) for everyone. It offers programmable money with privacy features, unlike most CBDCs that are confined to permissioned ledgers and centralized control. Ergo provides open systems that democratize access to financial systems, enabling secure and private financial interactions, seamless integration with emerging technologies like tokenization and digital identity, and complex programmable contracts. Ergo envisions a two-tier system with a native stablecoin for mainstream users and the native token (ERG) for advanced applications. By bridging traditional and blockchain economies, Ergo aims to be the future of money, accessible to everyone.
