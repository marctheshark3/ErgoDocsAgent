This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to host a pool on the Ergo blockchain. It covers the following key points:

1. Set up a local instance of the Ergo node, following the instructions in the "solo-node.md" guide and including the EIP27 rules.
2. Choose the pool software to use, either Miningcore or Ergo Stratum Server.
3. Configure the miner to point to the chosen pool software, using either the NV or AMD miner depending on the hardware.
