This document provides an overview of the Ergo Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that define standards for interaction between decentralized applications (dApps) and wallets, focusing primarily on EIP-0012 (dApp Connector). It covers the supported wallets, the typical connection flow, the Connection API and Context API functions, and best practices for security and testing. The document highlights the importance of requesting minimal permissions, ensuring user intent, providing transaction clarity, validating inputs, managing state securely, and avoiding storing sensitive data. It also covers considerations for mobile dApp development and provides recommendations for thorough testing across multiple wallets, on the Ergo Testnet, and for handling edge cases.
