The document provides an overview of using public explorer APIs to access indexed Ergo blockchain data for dApps and services. It covers the concept of public explorers maintaining indexed blockchain data and exposing it through APIs, the steps involved in using these APIs (identifying the explorer, making API requests, and processing the responses), common API endpoints, and code examples in JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. The document highlights the trade-offs of this approach compared to running a node or indexer, such as reduced control, performance, and flexibility.
