FlowCards aim to simplify dApp development on Ergo by providing a high-level declarative language, execution runtime, storage format and a graphical notation. ErgoScript, the smart contract language used by Ergo, is different from conventional languages due to Ergo's UTXO-based blockchain model. The account-based model of Ethereum is imperative, while Ergo's model is declarative, focusing on specifying conditions for a transaction to be accepted rather than changing storage state. Ergo's model offers benefits in scalability, shared state, and expressive power compared to Ethereum. FlowCards allow designing complex Ergo contracts in a declarative and visual way, where a transaction is a transformer of old boxes to new ones, preserving the balances of ERGs and tokens involved.
