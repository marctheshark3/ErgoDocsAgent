Options are financial contracts that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price and time. There are two types of options: call options, which give the buyer the right to buy an asset, and put options, which give the buyer the right to sell an asset. Options can be used to hedge against risk or speculate on price movements. The basic idea is that the buyer pays a premium for the right to buy or sell the asset, and if the price moves in their favor, they can exercise the option for a profit. If the price doesn't move in their favor, they can let the option expire and only lose the premium paid.
