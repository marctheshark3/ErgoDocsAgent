Merkle Trees are a fundamental data structure in the Ergo blockchain, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data. They are used in various blockchain operations, such as verifying transactions within blocks and securing additional metadata in the Extension Block. Ergo's Merkle Trees follow a specific structure and encoding scheme, with key characteristics like binary tree structure, cryptographic security, and deterministic byte representation. The core applications of Merkle Trees in Ergo include the Transaction Merkle Tree, the Extension Block Merkle Tree, Merkle Batch Proofs, and State Proofs. These Merkle Tree-based structures and proofs play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity, enabling efficient verification, and facilitating secure participation in the Ergo network.
