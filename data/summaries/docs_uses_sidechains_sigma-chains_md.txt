Sigma Chains represent a groundbreaking innovation designed to revitalize Proof of Work (PoW) and solidify Ergo's position as a hub. They are a series of blockchains that share the same contractual base layer, allowing for different chain-specific features and customization. Sigma Chains offer programmability, cross-chain compatibility, and economic sustainability, unlocking a multitude of possibilities for Ergo and its ecosystem.

Ergo is at the center of Sigma Chains, leveraging its advanced features and technologies to create a thriving network of interconnected blockchains. Sigma Chains prioritize cross-chain security, ensuring the interconnected network remains resilient and resistant to attacks. The growth of Sigma Chains will accelerate development and increase Ergo's mindshare in the blockchain space.

Key features of Sigma Chains include programmability, cross-chain compatibility, sustainability, security, and decentralization. Sigma Chains introduce an innovative approach to revitalizing PoW through merged mining, empowering portable projects and DApps to seamlessly interact across multiple blockchains.

Sigma Chains utilize a layered architecture, enabling the development of complex applications while maintaining the security and integrity of the blockchain. They introduce a novel approach to token distribution through smart contract-based emissions, rewarding investors, developers, and the community without the need for premining.

Sigma Chains offer various efficient sidechain constructions, including merged-mined sidechains, double merged-mined sidechains, and dedicated mining algorithms, catering to different use cases and mining preferences.
