CONTEXT.headers: The last 10 block headers preceding the current height.
CONTEXT.preHeader: The pre-header information available to miners.

The document also includes an example code snippet demonstrating how to access and use the data within the Blockchain Context to implement spending conditions for an ErgoScript contract.
