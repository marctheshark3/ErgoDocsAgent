The Transaction Merkle Tree is a vital data structure in the Ergo blockchain that ensures the integrity and authenticity of transactions within a block. It is similar to the Merkle Tree implementation in Bitcoin, but in Ergo, it combines both transactions and their corresponding spending proofs into a single Merkle Tree. The Merkle Tree structure allows for efficient verification of data integrity, with the Merkle Root serving as a cryptographic commitment to the entire dataset. The leaf nodes represent the hash of individual transactions and their spending proofs, while the internal nodes represent the hash of their child nodes. The Merkle Root is included in the block header, ensuring that the integrity of the entire block's transactions can be verified by simply verifying the root hash.
