This EIP defines a standard for interaction between "Hot" (online) and "Cold" (offline) mobile wallets for signing Ergo transactions. It addresses the "cold signing problem" where the full transaction context required for signing cannot be transferred to the cold wallet due to size limitations. The solution is to use a "ReducedTransaction" data structure that contains only the minimum information required for the cold wallet to generate the signature. The EIP also defines a transaction interchange format using ColdSigningRequest and ColdSigningResponse to securely transfer data between the hot and cold wallets. The benefits include improved security by isolating private keys on a cold device, and a universal protocol for cross-device interaction.
