Ergo's native tokens are versatile and can represent a wide range of assets. Tokens are deeply integrated into the Ergo protocol as first-class citizens, with unique characteristics like the inability to be burned and the requirement to pay storage rent in ERG. Minting tokens can be done through web tools or programmatically using the Fleet SDK. Tokens are stored in a special register R2 of a box, with a limit of 255 secondary tokens per box. The Ergo reference wallet uses specific registers for token metadata. There are limitations on box size and transaction costs due to the presence of tokens. New tokens can be created in a transaction if the asset identifier matches the identifier of the first input box, with a limit of one new asset per transaction.
