Multi-Stage Protocols utilize a technique involving transaction trees to mimic persistent storage in UTXO-based systems. This approach introduces on-chain computations and enables the execution of parallel actions within smart contracts, offering functionality akin to Ethereum's accounts but without the associated overhead. The concept is illustrated through various examples, including contracts for a Rock Paper Scissors game with provable fairness, a Reversible Address with anti-theft features, and a comprehensive ICO. The document also provides tutorials and guides for a deeper understanding of Multi-Stage Protocols, including ensuring secure user entry, bootstrap funneling, and the workflow for off-chain and on-chain development.
