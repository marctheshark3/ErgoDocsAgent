This tutorial focuses on implementing the backend server-side for ErgoPay, a decentralized application (dApp) on the Ergo blockchain. It covers using Spring Boot to build a simple ErgoPay REST API, including creating an endpoint to return an ErgoPayResponse object, building and reducing transactions using the Ergo SDK, and connecting a wallet to the dApp UI. The tutorial provides code examples and guidance on how to get started with the project, explore different transaction types, and integrate wallet connectivity. It also references an open-source ErgoPay showcase dApp as a reference for further development.
