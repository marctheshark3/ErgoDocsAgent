The document describes the technical workflow of a light full node in a blockchain system. The light full node operates by checking all the full blocks or a specified suffix of the full blockchain, starting from a trusted pre-genesis digest or a digest within the blockchain. It utilizes AD-transformations (authenticated dictionary transformations) to obtain a new digest from an old one, but it only stores a single digest and does not retain any transaction data. The light full node supports additional settings such as depth, additional-checks, and additional-depth. The workflow involves sending ErgoSyncInfo messages, requesting headers, performing validity checks, and requesting BlockTransactions and ADProofs. The node then applies the received modifiers and updates its state accordingly, with the option to drop older BlockTransactions and ADProofs in pruned-full mode.
