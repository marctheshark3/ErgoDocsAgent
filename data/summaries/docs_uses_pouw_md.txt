The document discusses the concept of Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) and its potential implementation on the Ergo platform. While PoUW is an interesting idea, it is still in the research phase, and implementing it would likely be beyond the scope and resources of Ergo's small core development team and limited budget. Ergo is considering conducting preliminary research and establishing specifications for PoUW, but its actual usefulness is still uncertain. The document highlights the practical challenges associated with PoUW implementation, such as finding a concrete approach that avoids potential private optimizations and the potential for collusion between payers and miners. The document suggests that during the bootstrapping phase, rewards should be determined by the protocol. The most realistic option seems to be launching a PoUW sidechain, but the document also asks what other possibilities could be explored to benefit the Ergo main chain and its ecosystem.
