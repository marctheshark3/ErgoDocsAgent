Addresses in Ergo are short strings that correspond to specific scripts and serve as a means to protect a box. Unlike Bitcoin, where addresses store a single amount, in Ergo's eUTxO model, a box contains registers that can store various values, including its native tokens. Ergo tokens are native and not smart contracts. The document provides information on different types of addresses used in Ergo and how to validate them. It also mentions a wallet visualization tool called Ergo Vision that can be used for investigating transactions and addresses.
