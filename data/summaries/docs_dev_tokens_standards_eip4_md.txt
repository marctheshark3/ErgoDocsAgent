This EIP-0004 document provides a standard for issuing Ergo tokens, which are supported as first-class citizens on the Ergo platform. The standard defines a structure for the box that issues a token, including registers for the token ID, name, description, and number of decimals. It also introduces an extension to this token standard, called the "asset type standard", which adds additional registers to support different types of assets such as NFTs and membership tokens. The document explains the purpose and structure of these asset type registers, providing examples for different asset categories.
