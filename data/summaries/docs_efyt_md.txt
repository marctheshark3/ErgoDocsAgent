Ergo-First-Year-Token (EFYT) was systematically airdropped and listed on the Waves DEX in May 2017, with an initial supply of 100,000 tokens. This launch aimed to build an early community and raise capital before the Ergo mainnet launch. EFYT is separate from ERG, the native Ergo token. The maximum EFYT supply is capped at 1,970,945, mirroring 10% of Ergo's first-year token emission. EFYT holders could exchange their tokens for ERG at a 1:1 rate until July 1, 2021. EFYT was initially used for team compensation and operational costs, with 500,000 EFYT sold to private investors.
