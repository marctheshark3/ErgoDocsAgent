Appkit is a library for polyglot development of Ergo Applications based on GraalVM. It provides a thin wrapper around core components of the ErgoScript interpreter and Ergo protocol implementations, allowing Ergo applications to be written in various languages supported by GraalVM. Appkit offers methods for fetching data from Ergo Explorer API, interacting with Ergo Node, building and signing transactions, and handling cryptographic operations. Ergo applications built with Appkit can be compiled into native code using the GraalVM native-image compiler, providing fast startup times and lower runtime memory overhead compared to a Java VM. The document includes tutorials, code examples, and references for using Appkit to develop Ergo applications.
