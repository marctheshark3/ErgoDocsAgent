Hodlcoin is a high-risk, high-reward game that encourages players to "HODL" their ERGs. Players can deposit ERGs into a common reserve or withdraw by burning their HODL ERGs, with un-HODLing incurring a penalty fee that is added to the reserve. The idea for Hodlcoin dates back to 2020 and was revisited in 2022, with a collaboration between developers leading to its rapid progression. However, a security vulnerability was discovered that allowed the bank box to be drained, prompting the development of a second version by community developers. The relaunched Hodlcoin now operates with two frontends using the same bank. The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the risks and managing them when participating in experimental decentralized finance.
