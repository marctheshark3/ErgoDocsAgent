Chat Bridge: Ergo ecosystem projects can establish a channel bridged between their server/Telegram using matterbridge. The document provides steps to set up the bridge, including inviting the BridgeBot to the Discord server and the ErgoBridgeBot to Telegram. Known limitations include Discord not allowing bots to reply to messages when spoofing someone, and the Telegram API not reporting deleted messages. Despite these limitations, the bridge works quite well, with names/profile-photos spoofed if similar on both platforms, and responses replying to the message on Telegram platforms and quoted on Discord.
