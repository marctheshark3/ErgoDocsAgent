The document provides an overview of hard forks in the Ergo blockchain. It explains that hard forks involve significant changes to the consensus mechanism or core protocol rules, requiring all nodes to upgrade to the new software version. Hard forks are necessary for major upgrades, bug fixes, and governance decisions. The implementation process includes development and testing, coordination with the network, and activation with monitoring. Hard forks are used for protocol upgrades, security fixes, and consensus changes. Careful planning, coordination, and testing are essential to ensure a smooth transition and avoid disruptions to the network.
