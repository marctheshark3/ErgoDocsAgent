Plasma is a library on top of Ergo Appkit that provides an abstraction layer to simplify the process of integrating AVL Trees (Plasma) into off-chain code. It aims to give developers an easy way to use this Layer-2 scaling solution in contracts, off-chain code, and distributed systems managing the Plasma itself. The library uses the default versioned storage implementation powered by LevelDB, with another SwayDB implementation in the works. It provides Plasma Maps, Local Plasma Maps, and Proxy Plasma Maps to interact with the AVL Trees. The document also includes references to example projects and resources related to Plasma.
