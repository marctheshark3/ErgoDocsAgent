This document provides instructions for building the Ergo Node from source code. It covers the prerequisites, including Git, Java Development Kit (JDK), and SBT (Scala Build Tool), and the step-by-step build process. The guide explains how to clone the Ergo repository, optionally check out a specific version, handle SNAPSHOT dependencies, compile the JAR file, and locate the generated JAR. It also mentions an alternative Docker-based build process and a link to the manual setup guide for further instructions after building the node.
