DegFi, or Degenerate Finance, is a subcategory within DeFi that focuses on high-risk, high-reward financial strategies and instruments. It operates on the fringes of traditional finance, amplifying potential gains and losses through complex mechanisms and game-theoretic interactions. DegFi is characterized by high-risk, high-reward, complexity and innovation, game-theoretic interactions, and community-led and speculative nature. Examples of DegFi include Hodlcoin, Auction Coin, and meme coins like COMET and Erdoge, which exemplify the transparent yet high-risk nature of this space.
