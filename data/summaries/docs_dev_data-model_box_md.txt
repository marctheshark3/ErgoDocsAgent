The Ergo 'Box' model is a transactional model similar to Bitcoin's UTXO model, where transactions create and consume single-use entities called 'boxes'. Ergo's boxes are more flexible than traditional UTXOs, as they can contain additional data, scripts, and registers beyond just the unspent transaction output balance. Each box has a unique ID derived from its contents, and transactions consist of both input and output boxes. Boxes are integral to the Ergo protocol, with the active box set authenticated through a hash-based data structure. The document provides details on box properties, functions, and example usage in ErgoScript.
