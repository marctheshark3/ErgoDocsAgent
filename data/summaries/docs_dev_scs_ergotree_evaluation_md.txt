The document presents the evaluation semantics of the ErgoTree language, which is specified by its translation to the Core-位 language. The Core-位 language is a subset of the ErgoTree language and its typing rules form a subset of the typing rules of ErgoTree. The evaluation semantics of Core-位 is based on call-by-value lambda calculus and is specified using denotational semantics. The document defines the values of the Core-位 language and explains the denotational semantics, where each type denotes a set whose elements are the denotations of values of that type.
