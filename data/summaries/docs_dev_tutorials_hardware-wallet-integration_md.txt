This document provides guidance for integrating Ergo support into hardware wallets using the sigma-rust library. Key challenges include the need for no_std compatibility, limited resources on hardware wallets, and dependency management. Strategies include using the sigma-rust-mini fork, replacing cryptographic backends to leverage the hardware wallet's optimized secp256k1 implementation, and minimizing dependencies. The essential functionality to port includes key derivation, address generation, transaction parsing, signing, and ErgoTree serialization/hashing. Collaboration within the developer community is crucial for advancing hardware wallet support for Ergo.
