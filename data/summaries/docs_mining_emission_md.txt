Ergo's emission schedule is capped at 97,739,925 ERGs, with the majority (93,409,132 ERGs) allocated to miner rewards over 2,080,800 blocks. The Ergo Foundation received 4.43% of the total emission for protocol development, ecosystem growth, and supporting decentralized infrastructure. Ergo's mining process is designed to be sustainable, with block rewards decreasing over time and revenue streams beyond emissions. Unique aspects of Ergo's emission include proof of no premine, rigorous verification using formal tools, and no out-of-thin-air emission, ensuring the integrity and scarcity of the native currency.
