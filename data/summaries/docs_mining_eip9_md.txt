This EIP specifies a hard-fork activation protocol for the Ergo blockchain, using the transition from Ergo Protocol v1 (EP1) to Ergo Protocol v2 (EP2) as an example. The hard-fork activation process consists of two phases: the first phase collects votes, selects the starting block for the hard-fork, and performs a safe switch, while the second phase is dedicated to code cleanup and optimizations enabled by the hard-fork. The key changes in EP2 include the switch from AOTC to JITC (Just-In-Time Costing), which requires a hard-fork. The voting process ensures that the majority of nodes have upgraded to the latest version before the hard-fork is activated, and that the AOTC and JITC interpreters produce the same results for all blocks up until the hard-fork block to maintain consensus.
