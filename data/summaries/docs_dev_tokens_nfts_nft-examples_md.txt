This document provides examples and code snippets for minting NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Ergo blockchain. It covers two approaches:

1. Using Scala with the "minting-for-dummies" tool, which provides a basic way to mint NFTs quickly.

2. Using the Ergo Python Appkit, which allows minting NFTs by initializing an ErgoAppKit instance and calling the `mintToken` method with the required parameters.

The document also includes references to related Ergo Python Appkit modules and classes, as well as additional examples for bulk minting NFTs with royalties and on-chain NFTs. It provides links to the relevant GitHub repositories and documentation for further information.
