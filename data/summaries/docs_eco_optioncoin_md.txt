OptionCoin is a novel concept that combines decentralized options trading with token emission on the Ergo blockchain. The OptionCoin smart contract periodically issues new tokens and sells them via call options, with the exercise price determined by the current market price on a decentralized exchange. Traders can buy or sell these call options, allowing them to speculate on the future price of OptionCoin. The funds received from selling the options and exercising the contracts are used to buy back OptionCoin tokens, creating a self-sustaining token economy. OptionCoin provides a decentralized and transparent method for token emission, offers options trading opportunities, and introduces a new DeFi primitive. Potential use cases include fundraising, speculation, risk management, and liquidity provision.
