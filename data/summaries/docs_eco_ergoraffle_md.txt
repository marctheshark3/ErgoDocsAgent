ErgoRaffle is a crowdfunding service built on the Ergo blockchain that allows anyone to raise funds for a project through a raffle system. The raffle has a deadline and a fundraising goal, and if the goal is reached, the project, winner, and service will be paid accordingly. The raffle is managed by smart contracts, ensuring no middlemen are involved and the system cannot be altered. Future plans include enabling raising funds in any token, allowing multiple winners, rewarding winners in any token including NFTs, implementing community upvoting/downvoting, enhancing the user interface, integrating dApp connectors and ErgoPay support, and introducing a refundable raffle creation fee to prevent scams and DoS attacks.
