The document discusses potential optimizations for processing ErgoScript contracts on the Ergo blockchain. It explains that before a contract can be stored, it must be compiled from source code into ErgoTree and then serialized into a byte array. The ErgoTree compiler can perform optimizations to reduce the size of the tree, resulting in normalization/unification where different scripts may compile into identical ErgoTrees. The obstacle to this optimization is the constants embedded in contracts. A solution is to avoid embedding constants and instead use indexed placeholder nodes, where the serialized ErgoTree contains the bytes of a constants collection and the bytes of the script expression with placeholders. This feature is the basis for EIP5.
