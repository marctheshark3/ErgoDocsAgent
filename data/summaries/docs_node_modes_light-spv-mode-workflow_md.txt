The document describes the technical workflow for the light-SPV mode in the Ergo blockchain. The workflow consists of two main phases: Bootstrap and Regular. In the Bootstrap phase, the client sends a GetPoPoWProof request to all connections, applies the received PoPoWProof to the History, and then transitions to the Regular regime. In the Regular regime, the client sends ErgoSyncInfo messages to connected peers, receives INV messages with block IDs, requests headers for those blocks, and applies the headers to the History and State. If the header application is successful, the client broadcasts an INV message for the new header; otherwise, it blacklists the peer.
