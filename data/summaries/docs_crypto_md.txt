This document provides an overview of the cryptographic schemes, protocols, and data structures used in the Ergo blockchain. Ergo's security model relies heavily on advanced cryptographic protocols, particularly composable Sigma protocols, which enable flexible, secure, and efficient proofs of knowledge and cryptographic operations within its smart contract framework. The document outlines Ergo's cryptographic toolkit, including hash functions, encoding, signing algorithms, primitive secrets, and non-interactive proofs. It then delves into the details of Sigma protocols, explaining how they work and their composability, which allows for the creation of powerful, privacy-preserving applications. The document also covers Schnorr signatures, a key part of Ergo's cryptographic foundation, and their use in various cryptographic schemes within the Ergo ecosystem.
