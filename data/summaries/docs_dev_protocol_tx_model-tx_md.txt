The document explains the difference between the Account model and the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model used in cryptocurrencies like Ergo. In the Account model, there is a single account where coins are received, while in the UTXO model, each transaction creates a new "box" or UTXO that holds the coins. The UTXO model allows for an unlimited number of boxes linked to a private key, and each receiving and spending action creates a new unique box. This can lead to a complex transaction history, where the network scans the user's boxes to verify the available balance and initiate a transaction. The document also provides an example of a transaction involving SigRSV tokens, where the UTXO model results in a long list of tokens being displayed, as the coins are stored in one-use UTXO boxes rather than long-living accounts.
