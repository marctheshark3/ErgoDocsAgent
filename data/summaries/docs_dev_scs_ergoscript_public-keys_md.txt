The document discusses public key scripts in ErgoScript, the smart contract language in Ergo. ErgoScript allows for the creation of scripts that can be spent by specific individuals, similar to P2PK addresses in Bitcoin. The most common method is using the `proveDlog(ecPoint)` predicate, which returns true if the spender can provide a valid proof of knowledge of the discrete logarithm corresponding to the elliptic curve point. Ergo uses the Secp256k1 curve and Schnorr signatures, unlike Bitcoin's ECDSA. The document provides a step-by-step guide to creating an address that encodes the `proveDlog` script, including obtaining the elliptic curve point and compiling the script.
