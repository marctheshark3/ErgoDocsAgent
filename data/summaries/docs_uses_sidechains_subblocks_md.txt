Ergo has introduced sub-blocks (input blocks) and ordering blocks, reducing typical onchain confirmation times from 2 minutes to 2 seconds, a 17x improvement. Sub-blocks are block candidates generated with lower difficulty, allowing faster transaction propagation and confirmation. Ordering blocks maintain the overall consensus and security of the blockchain. These changes provide users with near-instant confirmations and faster failure detection, transforming the mempool into a more cooperative environment and offering a smoother, more efficient experience on the Ergo network.
