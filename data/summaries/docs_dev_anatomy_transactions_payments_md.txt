Payments: ErgoPay and web dApp connectors serve similar purposes but have key differences. ErgoPay can connect any wallet with any dApp, while a web dApp connector is limited to web extension wallets and website dApps. As a dApp developer, you may need to run part of your logic on a server that can be accessed by user's wallet applications, which doesn't necessarily complicate things as you can choose the language and framework that best suits your needs.
