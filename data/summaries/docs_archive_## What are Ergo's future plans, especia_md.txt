Ergo's future plans include:
- Continuing to solve pain points in development, with a focus on improving user experience through sub-blocks and providing more developer resources like hardware wallets, courses, tutorials, and guides
- Expanding to more top-tier exchanges and improving marketing efforts
- Enabling the minting and transacting of new tokens, NFTs, and other assets for low fees in an open-source ecosystem
- Empowering the community to grow the ecosystem in a decentralized way through DAOs
- Positioning Ergo as a decentralized central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the people

Ergo sees itself as well-suited for Artificial Economic Intelligence (AEI) due to its simple contract handling and flexible templates. The community is building resources like SharkNet and an AI chatbot to support AEI development.

Privacy is a core principle for Ergo, implemented through opt-in protocols and robust cryptography. Ergo aims to avoid legal challenges by operating as a fully open-source platform with clear documentation and transparent development, as well as innovations like the ErgoMixer, SigmaJoin, and Mixicles.
