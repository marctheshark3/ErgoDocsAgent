BlockP2P is the peer-to-peer communication protocol that forms the backbone of Ergo's decentralized network. It facilitates the efficient and secure exchange of data, such as blocks, transactions, and synchronization information, between nodes without a central server. BlockP2P plays a critical role in block and transaction propagation, network synchronization, and maintaining the decentralized and resilient nature of the Ergo blockchain. The protocol incorporates security measures like message authentication and data validation to ensure the integrity of the exchanged information. Ergo's implementation of BlockP2P is designed to be highly efficient, with continuous improvements to enhance performance and security as the network grows.
