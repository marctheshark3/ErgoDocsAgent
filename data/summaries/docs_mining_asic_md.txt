The document discusses the mechanics of ASIC resistance in Autolykos v2, Ergo's mining algorithm. It examines how Autolykos v2 employs a dynamic strategy to resist ASICs by increasing the minimum GPU vRAM requirements over time, ensuring that any ASIC built to mine Ergo today will become inefficient after future updates. The document delves into the technical details of Autolykos v2, including the role of the memory table, the limitations of single-core ASIC loops, and the computational requirements. It also compares Autolykos to Ethash, highlighting Autolykos' higher reliance on memory bandwidth. The document explores potential optimizations and constraints, the importance of the Blake2b256 hashing algorithm, and the current assessment and future outlook of FPGAs in the Ergo ecosystem.
