The Rosen Bridge is designed to bootstrap liquidity across multiple ecosystems. The Rosen Token (RSN) serves as a sybil resistance mechanism, a fee distribution mechanism, and a means to access Rosen Bridge services. Watchers and Guards are required to stake RSN and ERG as collateral to participate in the system, and they can earn rewards for their services. The total RSN supply is 1,000,000,000, with 10% allocated for initial liquidity bootstrapping, 38.5% for future liquidity bootstrapping, 25% for event-based emission rewards, 2.5% for passive staking, 10.5% for the team budget, 10.5% for the treasury, and 3% for the Ergo Foundation. Rosen Bridge is self-funded with no private sales, venture capital, or SAFT agreements involved. The initial liquidity for Ergo was deposited on the Spectrum LP, and the project has received funding from Catalyst and the F10 program. The RSN token is needed for capital formation and to create incentives for the Rosen Bridge ecosystem.
