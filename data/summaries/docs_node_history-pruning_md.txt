History Pruning is a feature in Ergo's blockchain that allows nodes to reduce the amount of stored historical block data, which can lead to a significant decrease in storage requirements. The concept of pruning involves the removal of less relevant data while keeping the information necessary for maintaining the network's security and functionality. This is achieved using the `ergo.node.blocksToKeep` parameter, which dictates the number of full blocks the node should store. Once this limit is reached, the node will start pruning older blocks, removing the full transactions but retaining the block headers. The block headers are crucial for the operation of the blockchain, as they help maintain the integrity and continuity of the blockchain. By keeping the block headers, a node can still participate in verifying and validating new blocks and transactions, thus maintaining full-node security.
