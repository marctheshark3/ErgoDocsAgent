This document outlines the detailed process for validating Merkle proofs in the Ergo blockchain. The validation process involves computing a series of hashes based on the provided proof elements and comparing the final result with the expected Merkle root. The steps include computing the leaf node hash, iterating through the proof levels, and comparing the final computed hash with the Merkle root. The document provides code implementations for each step and a flowchart to visualize the validation process. It also includes an example of validating a transaction's inclusion in an Ergo block using a Merkle proof. The document emphasizes the importance of Merkle proof validation in ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient verification without the need to download the entire blockchain.
