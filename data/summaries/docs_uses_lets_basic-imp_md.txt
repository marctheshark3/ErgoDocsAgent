The document outlines the basic implementation of a Local Exchange Trading System (LETS) on the Ergo blockchain. It consists of two main contracts: an administrative contract and a trade contract. The administrative contract manages the LETS system, including adding new members and maintaining a directory of members. Each member is associated with a singleton token and a box that records their initial balance of zero. The administrative contract's logic can be updated over time by a committee, with changes to the committee's composition reflected in the R5 register of the contract. The trade contract safeguards the member's box. The document provides the ErgoScript code for the administrative contract, along with detailed explanations of its functionality.
