Auction Coin is a decentralized token distribution protocol built on the Ergo blockchain, designed to offer fairness, trustlessness, and improved price discovery in the token issuance process. It features token locking, periodic auctions for token emission, liquidity generation, and funding for project development. The protocol invites strategic "degen finance" interactions due to its transparent and predictable nature. Key aspects include an initial token lock, dynamic auction pricing, Erg accumulation and token buybacks, and a one-year emission schedule. Auction Coin aims to provide a novel approach to decentralized token distribution and financial interactions on the Ergo blockchain.
