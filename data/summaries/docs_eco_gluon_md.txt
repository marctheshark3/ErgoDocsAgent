Gluon is a new stablecoin protocol developed by Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo, Alexander Chapournoy, Kii, and Sangeet, with the support of the Djed Alliance. It aims to address the limitations of existing stablecoin protocols like Djed and SigmaUSD. Gluon has demonstrated strong performance on Ergo, surviving market crashes since early 2021. However, it has some concerns such as sensitivity to the oracle and reserve drainage by whales. The protocol functions as the dual of a liquidity pool, focusing on the pair of Stablecoin ReserveCoin (SigRSV and SigUSD). It introduces actions like fission, fusion, beta decay plus, and beta decay minus to enable the conversion of stablecoins and reservecoins. The protocol utilizes price equations and the Q ratio to determine the amounts obtained from these reactions. The implementation of Gluon on Ergo is underway, with Kii working on the backend and Sangeet on the frontend. Depending on the success of SigmaGold, Gluon might replace minimal Djed in SigmaUSD or be used to deploy a new USD stablecoin.
