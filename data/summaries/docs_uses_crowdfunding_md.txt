Crowdfunding is a way for users, developers, and miners on the Ergo network to work together to fund and advance the network. The Ergo Raffle allows projects to host raffles with a prize percentage allocated to donors. ErgoWell is a project for investing in ventures trying to raise money through crowdfunding. ErgoFund will eventually provide a more sophisticated crowdfunding experience, with contracts for campaigns with thousands of pledges and enable 'Self-Soverign DeFi'.
