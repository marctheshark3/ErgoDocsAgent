The document provides a deep dive into the structure of boxes in the Ergo blockchain ecosystem. Boxes are versatile containers that hold various types of information, including value, tokens, and custom data. They enable complex operations, such as executing scripts or smart contracts, directly on the blockchain. The key fields of a box include value, proposition bytes (the script), tokens, and registers (R4-R9) for storing data. The tokens field is an array of token ID and amount pairs, and the document includes an example script that checks the token ID and amount in the first output box.
