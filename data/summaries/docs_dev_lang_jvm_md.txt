This document provides an introduction to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is a runtime environment that allows developers to build applications using various programming languages such as Java, Scala, and Kotlin. The document highlights the use of AppKit, a library for polyglot development of Ergo applications. Additionally, it mentions two tools: ergo-playgrounds, which allows running Ergo contracts and off-chain code in the browser, and Ergo Contracts, which provides the source code of Ergo smart contracts along with compilation, testing, and formal verification tooling.
