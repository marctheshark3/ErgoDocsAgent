The document outlines best practices for using the ErgoMixer, a decentralized mixing protocol that enhances privacy by obfuscating transaction trails. Key points include:

- Withdraw mixed funds to multiple addresses over time to maintain privacy.
- The mixer operates through "mini-mixes" where your funds are mixed with another user's available box from the pool.
- Larger pool size and more honest participants increase the anonymity set and security.
- Longer mixing intervals increase the likelihood of mixing with honest parties, reducing an attacker's ability to track funds.
- As long as at least one honest party is mixing, the resulting mapping will be indistinguishable to some degree from an attacker's perspective.
