Schnorr Signature is a core cryptographic primitive used in Ergo transactions. It is simple, efficient, and secure, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of cryptographic functionalities in Ergo. Ergo's Schnorr signatures are implemented using the SecP256K1 elliptic curve, the same curve used in Bitcoin. The flexibility of Schnorr signatures enables Ergo to support applications from simple transactions to advanced multi-signature schemes and privacy-enhancing protocols. Schnorr signatures can be generalized into complex Sigma protocol proofs, allowing for privacy-preserving multi-party computations and other advanced cryptographic applications. Key use cases include MuSig (multi-signature protocols), which enhances privacy and efficiency by allowing multiple participants to collaboratively generate a Schnorr signature.
