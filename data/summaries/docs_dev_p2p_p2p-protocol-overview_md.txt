Ergo's network protocol relies on full nodes (peers) to establish a cooperative peer-to-peer network for block and transaction exchange, ensuring a decentralized, robust system with high security and integrity. Full nodes download and verify every block and transaction to maintain a complete copy of the blockchain, contributing to the network's resilience. The handshake process establishes connections between peers, sharing details like handshake time, agent name, and network protocol version. The Ergo P2P protocol includes various network messages for node discovery, synchronization, object inventory transmission, and modifier requests. The modifier exchange process encompasses the protocols and systems to exchange blocks and transactions efficiently and securely across the network. The synchronization process involves transitioning the state of modifiers from 'Unknown' to 'Held,' utilizing protocols like Inv, Headers synchronization, and Block Section synchronization, facilitated by the DeliveryTracker and NodeViewHolder.
