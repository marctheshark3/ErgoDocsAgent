The document discusses the Ergo Mosaik, a UI system for Ergo dApps, and covers two main use cases: 1) showing an informational page in web browsers visiting the Mosaik app, and 2) running the Mosaik app within a web browser. It explains how to handle the first use case by moving the Mosaik app to a different URL and serving an HTML page with a hint for Mosaik executors. For the second use case, it introduces the Mosaik web executor, an interactive website that can run Mosaik apps without the need for a browser plugin. The document also covers adding support for the ErgoPay wallet connection in the Mosaik web executor. Finally, it concludes by inviting developers to provide feedback on the Mosaik framework and its development.
