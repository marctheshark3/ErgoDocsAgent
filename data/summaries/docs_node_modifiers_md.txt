Ergo Modifiers are the fundamental units of data exchanged between nodes in the Ergo P2P protocol, such as blocks and transactions. The Ergo block structure consists of four distinct sections: Header, Block Transactions, ADProofs, and Extension. The Header section contains the minimal information necessary to synchronize the chain and validate Proof-of-Work correctness, including cryptographic hashes and other critical data. The Extension section functions as a key-value store for storing various data relevant to the block or protocol state, including blockchain parameters and NiPoPoW interlinks.
