Dexy is a seigniorage-based stablecoin design that leverages oracle price feeds and a liquidity pool to maintain a peg. The key components include an emission contract for minting new Dexy tokens, a liquidity pool for buying and selling Dexy, an arbitrage mechanism, and top-up swaps to stabilize the price. The design incorporates anti-draining measures to prevent cyclic draining of the emission contract. Potential vulnerabilities include draining attacks, oracle manipulation, and demand shifts. Thorough modeling, simulation, and monitoring are crucial for the system's stability and resilience. Dexy differs from Terra's model by using overcollateralization, and the collateral levels may vary over time. The project is currently under development, with the first implementation being DexyGold, which aims to maintain a peg to the USD/XAU (gold) price.
