The document provides an overview of Ergo's approach to forking, which aims to avoid disruptive hard forks unless absolutely critical. Ergo implements measures to prevent hard forks, such as pushing complexity to the application layer and enabling soft-forks. The document outlines different fork types, including velvet-forks, soft-forks, and hard-forks, and the fork activation process, which involves proposal, consensus, and supermajority (90%+) approval. Ergo's goal is to maintain a stable and secure network while enabling continuous improvement and innovation.
