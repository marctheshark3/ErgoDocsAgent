Sigma Propositions (SigmaProp) are the core return type of every ErgoScript contract. They represent conditions related to the transaction that must be met to spend a specific box. SigmaProp values can be constructed in several ways, such as from boolean expressions using the sigmaProp function, or from public keys using the proveDlog function. SigmaProp values can be combined using logical operations like && and || to build more complex spending logic. The document provides a simple example of a pin-lock contract that checks if the output box's register R4 contains the Blake2b256 hash of the input box's register R4. The two versions of the pin-lock contract, one using INPUTS(0) and the other using SELF, are equivalent under certain spending conditions.
