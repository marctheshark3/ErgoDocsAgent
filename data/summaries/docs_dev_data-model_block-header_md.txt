The block header in Ergo serves as a concise summary of a block's critical information, playing a vital role in maintaining the integrity and security of the blockchain. It enables efficient synchronization between nodes, validates the miner's Proof-of-Work solution, and ensures the integrity of the entire block. The header contains key components such as the version, parent ID, ADProofs root, state root, transactions root, timestamp, difficulty target, height, extension root, Proof-of-Work solution, and votes. These elements work together to uphold the blockchain's security and facilitate its operation.
