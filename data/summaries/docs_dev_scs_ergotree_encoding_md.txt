ErgoTree encoding is a binary formatting system designed for the storage, transfer, and cross-platform operation of ErgoTree contracts. It uses Variable Length Quantity (VLQ) encoding for integer representation, which is an effective scheme that accommodates integer representation using a variable number of bytes. ErgoTree also employs ZigZag encoding to efficiently encode signed 64-bit integers using variable-length encoding. The document provides detailed explanations and code examples for these encoding techniques.
