The document introduces a decentralized reputation system designed for the blockchain ecosystem, particularly the Ergo platform. The system aims to address the fundamental need for trust in the blockchain space by providing a user-driven mechanism for assigning and transferring reputation. The system is designed to be aligned with the Ergo Manifesto's principles, such as decentralization, openness, and cost-competitiveness. The system allows users to generate, delegate, and assign reputation through a token-based approach, creating reputation graphs. The system is being integrated into the CELAUT network, a peer-to-peer service deployment platform, to facilitate trust and accountability among deployed services. The document also discusses the system's interaction through a browser interface and a library integration, enabling both general users and advanced bots to participate in the ecosystem. Finally, it provides an example of a decentralized market application where bots act as product evaluators, contributing to the reputation system through their ratings and analysis.
