ADProofs (Authenticated Data Proofs) are a crucial component of Ergo's block structure that allows for efficient and secure validation of transactions without requiring full blockchain download, particularly beneficial for light clients. They enable light clients to verify the validity of transactions within a block by proving they are included in the Merkle tree of the UTXO set, and to calculate the new state root after applying the transactions, allowing them to stay synchronized with the blockchain without storing the complete state. ADProofs are cryptographically secure, ensuring that any tampering with the transactions or the UTXO set will be detected during validation. The ADProofs structure includes the block header ID and the serialized cryptographic proof that allows for verification of the state changes. The verification process involves the client using the ADProofs to construct a BatchAVLVerifier, which utilizes the proof bytes to verify the transactions and state changes.
