The document describes the transaction signing process in a blockchain system. It explains that a spending transaction (tx) and the current state of the blockchain (context) are required to initiate a transaction. The signer (or prover) of an input begins by reducing the guarding proposition for the input box using the context. The possible outcomes of this reduction are discussed, including aborting the process if the evaluation cost is too high, or proceeding if the expression can be fully evaluated using the available information. The document then explains the process of proving a complex expression represented as a tree, using a bottom-up approach.
