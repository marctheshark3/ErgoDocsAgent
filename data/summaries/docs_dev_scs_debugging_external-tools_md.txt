This document discusses the external tools and simulators available for debugging ErgoScript, the scripting language used in the Ergo blockchain. It highlights the importance of these off-chain tools in testing and understanding ErgoScript contract behavior, given the limitations of direct on-chain debugging. The document covers three main categories of tools:

1. Simulators, such as the Spectrum Finance ErgoScript Simulator, which allow for off-chain execution of ErgoScript code.
2. SDK Playgrounds and REPLs, like the ones provided by the Fleet SDK, which offer interactive environments for experimenting with script snippets and context building.
3. Online editors and compilers, such as escript.online, which help with writing scripts and catching syntax errors.

The document also mentions the community's desire for more sophisticated debugging tools, including enhanced simulators with features like breakpoints, step-through execution tracing, and detailed state inspection capabilities. It emphasizes that using these external tools effectively complements the core practices of thorough testing and careful design.
