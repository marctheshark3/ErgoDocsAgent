Key advantages over Zerojoin include non-interactive mixing, outsourceability to third-party mixers, support for more than two types of mix boxes, and outsourced fee handling. Special features include outsourceability, stealth withdraw, and outsourced fee. The protocol uses special "mix-boxes" with two registers a and b as elements of a mathematical group G.
