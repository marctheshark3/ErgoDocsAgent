ErgoTool is a command-line interface for the Ergo blockchain that allows users to perform various operations without running their own Ergo node. The document covers the steps to generate a mnemonic phrase, create a local secret storage, and use it to send ERGs between addresses using ErgoTool commands. It also explains how to extract data from the secret storage, list unspent boxes, and transfer coins using the "send" command.
