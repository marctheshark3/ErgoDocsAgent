Reversible Addresses are a type of multi-stage contract designed with anti-theft features. Funds sent to this address can initially only be spent in a way that allows the payment to be reversed by a trusted party for a specific period. After this period, only the intended recipient can spend the funds. This mechanism is useful for managing hot wallets, where the private key is stored on a server and vulnerable to compromise. The reversible address uses a two-stage protocol: the first stage ensures withdrawals adhere to specific rules, and the second stage allows either the intended recipient or the trusted party to spend the funds. If an unauthorized transaction is detected, the trusted party can use their private key to divert the funds to a secure address. These addresses can also be used for automated-release escrow payments in online shopping.
