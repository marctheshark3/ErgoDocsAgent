The document discusses "Anyone-Can-Spend Scripts" in ErgoScript, which are the simplest form of ErgoScript and consist of a single boolean predicate that always evaluates to true. This means that any funds sent to the corresponding address can be spent by anyone. The document provides an example of such a script, `true && (false || true)`, which corresponds to the address `NwAyzZpF2KcXAGBJvPrAH`.
