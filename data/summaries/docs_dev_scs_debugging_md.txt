This document provides an overview of debugging strategies for ErgoScript, the smart contract language used in the Ergo blockchain. It emphasizes the importance of thorough off-chain testing and careful contract design, as on-chain debugging is limited. The guide covers specific debugging techniques, including using Scala-based tools, on-chain mechanisms, and external simulators. It also discusses the need for more advanced debugging tools as the ecosystem evolves, while stressing that rigorous off-chain testing remains the cornerstone of developing reliable ErgoScript contracts.
