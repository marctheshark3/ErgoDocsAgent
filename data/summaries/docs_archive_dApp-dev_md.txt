The document discusses the vision for decentralized finance (DeFi) and how it should evolve, focusing on four key areas: privacy, scalability, interoperability, and decentralization. It highlights the importance of privacy as an integral feature of DeFi, the need for scalability to enable high transaction throughput, the necessity of interoperability to enable cross-platform composability, and the significance of decentralization to strengthen the security and resilience of the DeFi ecosystem. The document also contrasts DeFi with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), noting that the latter lack the composability and privacy features that are essential for the growth and adoption of decentralized finance.
