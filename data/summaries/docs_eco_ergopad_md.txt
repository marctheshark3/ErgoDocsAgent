Ergopad is a platform within the Ergo ecosystem that facilitates the incubation and launch of new projects. It provides a mechanism for token IDOs, which serve as a source of funding for these projects. Ergopad has its own native token that can be staked by users, enabling them to contribute to the DAOs of projects initiated on the platform. The funds collected by these DAOs are allocated towards the development of projects on Ergo as decided by DAO members. Ergopad aims to support grassroots projects in shaping the future of global finance by creating products that democratize participation in commerce.
