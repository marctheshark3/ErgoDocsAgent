Ergo's transaction fee system is designed to be flexible and explicit. While the protocol does not enforce a minimum transaction fee, transactions without a fee are less likely to be included in a block by miners. Each box in a transaction must adhere to a minimum value determined by a parameter voted on by miners and the size of the box, which helps prevent the creation of dust in Ergo.

The fee is calculated based on the serialized size of the boxes being created, with a minimum threshold of 360 nanoerg per byte. Miners prioritize transactions based on either the fee per byte or the validation cost unit, which are adjustable via a voting mechanism.

Transaction fees are secured in a contract that can only be spent through a miner's script. The appropriate transaction fee must meet the protocol's minimum requirements, and the recommended confirmation levels vary depending on the network hashrate.

Ergo also supports Babel Fees, which enable users to pay transaction fees using tokens like SigmaUSD instead of ERG.
