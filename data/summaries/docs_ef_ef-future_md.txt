The Ergo Foundation's initial role was to bootstrap the Ergo ecosystem and build the necessary infrastructure. This has led to a vibrant ecosystem with over 300 community developers, 100 active contributors, and over 140 projects developing on Ergo. 

As the ecosystem matures, the Ergo Foundation's importance should diminish, and responsibility should transition towards the community. The Foundation may continue to exist as a legal entity to mitigate counterparty risk, but its focus will be on promoting blockchain technology for societal benefit, advocating for decentralized infrastructure, and upholding privacy. 

The Sigmanauts Program is a grassroots initiative aimed at empowering individuals to take ownership of Ergo and shape its future, enabling the community to contribute to Ergo's development.
