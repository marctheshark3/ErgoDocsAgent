NiPoPoW Sidechains are a novel technology that enables trustless sidechains by leveraging Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) proofs to provide resistance against potential attacks, while maintaining a small size for efficient network transmission. NiPoPoWs introduce a paradigm shift in how information is verified across blockchains without trusting centralized parties, enabling broader interoperability and enhancing the scalability of blockchains.

NiPoPoW sidechains utilize superblocks, which are blocks with significantly more work than average blocks, to form a backbone that provides a high-level, compressed version of the blockchain's proof-of-work history, enabling efficient verification by sidechains. This allows sidechains equipped with NiPoPoW verifiers to validate proofs without having access to the full blockchain data of another chain, crucial for efficient cross-chain transactions.

NiPoPoW sidechains have various applications, including enabling secure and trustless cross-chain transactions, facilitating the seamless transfer of assets for use in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, and acting as a scaling solution by offloading transactions from a congested main chain to a faster, more efficient sidechain.
