Solo mining is a method of mining Ergo independently, without joining a mining pool. This approach can be more rewarding if you have significant mining power, but it also comes with higher variance in rewards. Before deciding to solo mine, you can use a calculator to evaluate if it's the right choice for you. If you decide to proceed with solo mining, you have two options: using a mining pool's solo port or hosting your own mining pool. Solo mining requires a good understanding of the mining process and a significant amount of resources. To be able to spend any ERG mined via the reference client, you will need to include the EIP27 rules in your ergo.conf.
