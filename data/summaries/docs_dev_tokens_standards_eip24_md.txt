EIP-0024 proposes a standard for artwork contracts on the Ergo blockchain. The key points are:

1. The issuance box follows the Asset standard and the issuer box has the same ID as the artwork's token ID, which can be used to verify artwork features.
2. The issuer box has an R4 register that specifies the royalty percentage (up to 100%) for the artwork.
3. Version 2 of the standard introduces an R5 register to specify a list of royalty recipients and their respective percentages.
4. The R6 register contains properties, levels, and stats about the artwork.
5. The artist's identity is determined by the first P2PK input in the chain of transactions leading to the artwork issuance.
