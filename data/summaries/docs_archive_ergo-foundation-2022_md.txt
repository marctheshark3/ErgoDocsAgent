The Ergo Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the adoption of the Ergo platform. The Foundation's Treasury is sourced from a portion of mined blocks during the first 2.5 years of Ergo's mainnet launch. The Foundation's mission is to promote the development and widespread adoption of the Ergo platform, develop the ecosystem, and support privacy and decentralized infrastructure. The Foundation is led by Alexander Chepurnoy, Alexander Slesarenko, Justin Simpson, Joseph Armeanio, and Mark Glasgow. Key achievements in 2020 and 2021 include partnerships, listings, protocol upgrades, and community growth. In 2022, the Foundation expanded with new officers and continued to drive ecosystem development through listings, protocol upgrades, summits, and hackathons. The Foundation's scope includes supporting protocol research, development, and infrastructure, as well as educational initiatives.
