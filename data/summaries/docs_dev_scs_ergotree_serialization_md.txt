The document defines the binary format used to serialize ErgoTree contracts for storage, transfer, and cross-platform interoperability. It specifies the serialization limits and formats for different data types, expressions, and the overall ErgoTree contract. The serialization is optimized for compact storage and rapid deserialization. The document covers the serialization of types, data, constants, and the overall ErgoTree structure. It also provides a detailed description of the distribution of type codes and the encoding of data types.
