The document provides a comparative analysis of GPU and CPU mining, focusing on the Autolykos and RandomX algorithms. It discusses the pursuit of ASIC resistance, the technical details of the RandomX and Autolykos algorithms, the decentralization dilemma and the botnet threat, and the limits of memory-hardness as an ASIC-resistance strategy. The key points are:

- Cryptocurrency projects aim to achieve decentralization by enabling mining on widely available hardware, leading to the pursuit of ASIC-resistant algorithms.
- RandomX leverages the complexity of modern CPU design to make CPUs the most efficient "ASICs" for its algorithm, while Autolykos seeks to balance GPU accessibility and ASIC resistance.
- The low barriers to entry in CPU mining have made RandomX a target for botnets, undermining decentralization, while Autolykos' GPU focus aims to maintain accessibility while increasing ASIC resistance.
- The effectiveness of memory-hardness as an ASIC-resistance strategy has come into question, as advances in memory technology have made it more feasible to implement memory-bound algorithms in specialized hardware.
