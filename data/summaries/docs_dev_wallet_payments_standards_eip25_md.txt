EIP-0025 proposes a URI scheme for initiating Ergo payments, similar to BIP-0021 for Bitcoin. The purpose is to enable users to easily make payments by clicking links on webpages or in emails. The URI contains the address, amount, label, description, and token details, allowing the wallet to fill the payment form. The wallet should process the URI as long as it can parse and interpret the content unambiguously, and display any implicit actions to the user. The document provides examples of valid URIs and guidelines for wallet implementation.
