SmartPools are a decentralized alternative to traditional mining pools, replacing centralized mining pools with autonomous on-chain smart contracts. The concept of SmartPools was first introduced at the ErgoHacks event, and the Lithos Protocol represents the next generation of SmartPools. SmartPools aim to address issues associated with centralized mining pools, such as high fees, lack of transparency, and the threat to network security. The SmartPools mining model offers advantages like verifiable and fair mining pool contracts and reward schemes, on-chain deduction of fees, and prevention of hash-power manipulation. Ergo believes that SmartPools represent a necessary step towards future decentralization in blockchain technology.
