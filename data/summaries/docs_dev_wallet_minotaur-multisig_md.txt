The document describes the implementation of a multi-signature wallet in the Minotaur wallet, a multi-platform wallet developed using TypeScript. The key points are:

The wallet allows multiple private keys to authorize transactions, enabling management by a single user with multiple keys or multiple users with one key each. The wallet supports configuring the number of required signatures (N) out of the total number of signers (M).

The wallet creation process involves each signer configuring a copy of the wallet with the same M and N values, entering their private key and the public keys of other signers, and deriving a unique address for the multi-sig wallet.

The wallet provides standard wallet functionalities like displaying balances and transaction history. The address derivation and transaction signing processes are implemented to handle the multi-sig requirements, involving the generation and sharing of commitments between signers.

The "sign transaction" modal facilitates the multi-sig signing process, allowing signers to generate and share commitments until the required number of signatures is reached, at which point the final signed transaction is created.
