This document provides a comprehensive guide to building a custom indexer for Ergo blockchain data. It covers the core tasks involved in a custom indexer, including connecting to an Ergo node API, fetching and parsing new blocks, extracting relevant data, storing it in a database, and handling blockchain reorganizations. The document also recommends leveraging existing open-source tools and frameworks, such as the Ergo Blockchain Scanner and Explorer Chain-Grabber, to simplify the development process. It discusses various database options, including PostgreSQL, RocksDB, and MongoDB, and highlights key challenges and considerations, such as initial sync, reorg handling, and selective indexing. The document also provides examples of existing indexer solutions, including ErgoWatch and Pragmaxim's Chain Indexer.
