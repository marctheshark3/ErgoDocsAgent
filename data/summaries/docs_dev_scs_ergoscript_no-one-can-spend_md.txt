ErgoScript can create programs that always evaluate to false, resulting in addresses to which funds can be sent but not spent. These are referred to as no-one-can-spend scripts. It is important not to send funds to these addresses as they cannot be retrieved. Ergo has a mechanism called 'garbage collection' or storage rent that ensures boxes produced by no-one-can-spend scripts are eventually removed from the blockchain to maintain system efficiency.
