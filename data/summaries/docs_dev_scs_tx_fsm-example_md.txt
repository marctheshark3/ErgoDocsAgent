This tutorial provides an introduction to Finite State Machines (FSMs) and how they can be implemented in Ergo using the eUTXO model. It covers the key concepts of state representation, transitions, and immutability. The tutorial includes an example of a simple vending machine FSM implementation in ErgoScript, highlighting the benefits of using FSMs in Ergo, such as clear state management, composability, security, and predictability. The document also mentions advanced concepts like Merkleized Finite State Machines (MFSMs) and long-lived contracts, and emphasizes the importance of careful planning when implementing robust FSMs.
