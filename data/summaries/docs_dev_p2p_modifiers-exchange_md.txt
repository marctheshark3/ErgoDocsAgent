The document provides an overview of the Modifier Exchange process in the Ergo P2P protocol. Modifiers represent blocks and transactions, which are fundamental elements in the Ergo network. The Modifier Exchange process involves three main steps: Inventory Transmission (Inv), Modifier Request (RequestModifier), and Modifier Delivery (Modifier). This process ensures that all nodes in the network maintain an up-to-date state of the blockchain, which is crucial for the integrity and performance of the Ergo network. The document also provides references to the relevant source code files in the Ergo repository for a deeper understanding of how modifiers are implemented and managed.
