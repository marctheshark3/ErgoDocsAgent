ErgoData is a potential sidechain that could be launched on the Ergo blockchain. The main purpose of ErgoData is to serve the needs of data-intensive applications, such as land registries and certificate directories. ErgoData would be similar to the existing Ergo Protocol, but with some modified parameters.

The plans for launching ErgoData are currently unclear. The network will only be launched if users show demand for it after Ergo has established a solid infrastructure base. If the ErgoData chain is launched, EFYT holders at the time of the Ergo launch will receive ErgoData tokens, as a snapshot of EFYT holders has already been taken.
