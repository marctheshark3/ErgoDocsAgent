The document outlines funding opportunities for projects in the Ergo ecosystem. It suggests starting with a Raffle to validate community support and set a clear funding goal. For larger-scale projects, it recommends seeking funding through the Good Whale Fund or the DarkFund0, which provide platforms to introduce projects to the community. The document also offers the option to send grant requests directly to the Ergo team at team@ergoplatform.org.
