Ergo's royalty system is integrated into the minting metadata and can be accessed via smart contracts. Marketplaces can include royalties in their sale contracts, ensuring that royalties are embedded in the smart contract and cannot be bypassed. However, for direct transfers or private sales, the decision to honor the royalties lies with the involved parties. The upcoming AuctionHouse V3 will introduce the ability to support multiple recipients for royalties, facilitating collaborations among artists.
