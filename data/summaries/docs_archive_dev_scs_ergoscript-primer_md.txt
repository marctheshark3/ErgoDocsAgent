ErgoScript is a programming language designed for writing smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. It uses a UTXO-based model, which provides improved security and scalability. ErgoScript is declarative, allowing developers to specify what should happen rather than how. It leverages Sigma Protocols, enabling advanced cryptographic features like complex signature schemes and privacy features. The document provides an introduction to ErgoScript, including its key characteristics and basic syntax. It also mentions development tools like the ErgoScript P2S Playground and the Ergo AppKit framework for building Ergo applications.
