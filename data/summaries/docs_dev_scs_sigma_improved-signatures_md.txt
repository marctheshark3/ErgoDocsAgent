The document discusses improvements made to the distributed signatures support in the Ergo node. The initial implementation had issues where the generated hints (such as commitments) were not tied to the position of a sub-expression within the overall sigma-expression or to specific transaction inputs. These issues have been fixed in the new API introduced in the `distributed-sigs` branch. The new API ensures that all hints are tied to both input indexes and positions within the sigma tree after the script reduction phase. The document then walks through a new tutorial on collective signing using the improved API, demonstrating the usage of a 2-out-of-3 spending script where the public keys are stored in registers.
