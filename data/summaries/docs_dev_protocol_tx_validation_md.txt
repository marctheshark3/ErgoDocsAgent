The document outlines the transaction validation rules for the Ergo platform, which are divided into stateless and stateful checks. Stateless checks include ensuring a transaction has at least one input and output, output amounts are non-negative, and limits on the number of assets. Stateful checks include verifying inputs are in the UTXO set, input and output amounts match, and spending proofs are valid. Full-block validation rules are also described, such as ensuring all transactions reference valid inputs, the total validation cost does not exceed a limit, and the UTXO set root hash matches the block header. The document notes that emission rules and extension validation rules need to be added.
