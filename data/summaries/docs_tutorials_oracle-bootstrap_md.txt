This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to bootstrap an Oracle Pool on the Ergo blockchain. It covers the following key points:

1. Planning the pool parameters, such as the number of oracles, minimum data points, and voting requirements.
2. Generating a bootstrap config template and setting the required parameters.
3. Editing the bootstrap config template with the planned pool parameters and other details.
4. Running the bootstrap command to mint the tokens and create the pool.
5. Inviting other operators by sending them the necessary tokens.
6. Starting the oracle and monitoring the pool's operation.
7. Sending the pool config file to the other operators so they can start their oracles.
