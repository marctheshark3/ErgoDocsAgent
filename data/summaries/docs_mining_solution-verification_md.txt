Solution verification is the process of validating that a miner has solved the mathematical puzzle required to add a block to the blockchain network. Test vectors are necessary for solution verification as they provide a standardized set of inputs and outputs to test the accuracy and correctness of the verification process. The document provides test vectors for the Ergo cryptocurrency, including the block height, item count, and sample hash values for specific item indices. The test vectors help ensure the integrity of the mining process and the security of the blockchain.
