The document discusses the use of Merkle Batch Proofs on the Ergo blockchain. It provides an overview of the current state of Merkle Tree and Batch Proof support in the Ergo ecosystem, highlighting that while the `sigma-rust` library fully supports these features, integration into the core `sigmastate-interpreter` is still in progress. The document then presents step-by-step guides for using Merkle Batch Proofs in both Rust-based and JVM-based Ergo applications, covering the creation of Merkle Trees, generation of Batch Proofs, proof verification, and serialization/deserialization.
