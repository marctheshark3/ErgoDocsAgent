The document provides an overview of the Proof of Proof-of-Work (PoPow) data structures used in the Ergo blockchain. PoPow is an advanced protocol that enables lightweight clients to efficiently verify the blockchain's integrity without downloading the entire chain. The key data structures discussed are:

1. Interlink Vectors: These store references to previous block headers at different difficulty levels, allowing clients to verify the chain by checking only a subset of blocks.

2. NiPoPoW (Non-Interactive Proof of Proof-of-Work) Proofs: These proofs allow clients to verify the correct chain (with the most cumulative work) without interacting with the network.

3. Merkle Trees: These are used to create cryptographic proofs that verify the inclusion of specific data elements, such as block headers or interlink references, in the NiPoPoW proof.

The document explains how these data structures interact to provide a secure and efficient solution for lightweight blockchain verification. It also includes a step-by-step example of constructing a NiPoPoW proof using the PoPow data structures.
