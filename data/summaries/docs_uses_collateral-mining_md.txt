Collateral Mining is a unique feature of the Ergo Blockchain that provides an innovative approach to mining and incentivizes participation in the network. It allows miners to utilize their collateral as a stake to participate in the mining process. The architecture consists of a collateral box script that defines three main cases for receiving mining rewards: block mined by the miner, collateral top-up by anyone, and collateral withdrawal by the miner. The primary limitation is that only one unspent collateral box can exist at a time for a given miner public key. The pool reward can be adjusted to provide additional incentives, and miners also receive all transaction fees associated with the blocks they mine. The document provides additional resources for further understanding and engagement with Collateral Mining on the Ergo Blockchain.
