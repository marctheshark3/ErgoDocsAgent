Rust is used for off-chain components in the Ergo blockchain ecosystem, such as interacting with the blockchain, creating transactions, and building applications. Developers can use Rust along with frameworks like sigma-rust, which provides a Rust port of the sigmastate-interpreter, allowing them to interact with the Ergo blockchain from their Rust applications. The UTXO transactional model used by Ergo is crucial for developing off-chain components, as it differs from the account-based model used by other blockchains. The document also mentions several Rust-based frameworks and utilities that simplify working with the Ergo blockchain, including HDF, RustKit, Ergo Utilities, ergo-monitoring, and a Rust AVL tree implementation.
