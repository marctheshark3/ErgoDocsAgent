Bonding curves are a useful primitive for continuous token offerings (CTOs), augmented bonded curves, and perhaps AMM DEXes. There is a cheap way to do bonding curves on Ergo, with most of the load performed off-chain. The document discusses two scenarios: a sell-only token sale and a sell with buy-back scenario. In the sell-only scenario, the token issuer creates boxes with a set price for the token in register R4, and the box is spendable if the spending transaction pays the price to the issuer's address. In the sell with buy-back scenario, the selling contract requires a spending transaction to lock 95% of the price, at least with buying contract, which is time-locked and requires a spending transaction to send the token bought-back to a predefined address. Clients need to perform some work to find boxes associated with the token and selling-script, and then sort the boxes by R4.
