This document provides an introduction to Scala development with the Ergo platform. Ergo's primary language is Scala, and its scripting language ErgoScript is also based on Scala. The document highlights the advantages of Scala, such as its cross-platform capabilities, conciseness, and multi-paradigm nature. It also discusses the migration of Ergo's core components to Scala 3, including the rationale and implications for developers. The document includes a list of learning resources, such as tutorials and guides, as well as development resources like the sigmastate-interpreter, ScoreX, and Scrypto libraries, which can assist developers in their Scala development journey with Ergo.
