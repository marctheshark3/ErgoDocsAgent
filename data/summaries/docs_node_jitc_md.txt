Just-In-Time Costing discusses transaction efficiency, scalability, and costing in the cryptocurrency space. Scalability refers to a blockchain's capacity to handle an increasing number of transactions, while costing refers to the computational expense associated with validating transactions and smart contracts. Ergo's Protocol Reference Client 5.0.0 introduced a hybrid costing model that combines Ahead-of-Time (AOT) and Just-In-Time (JIT) costing. The hybrid model operates in two stages: a Reduction Stage using JIT costing to calculate the cost of script reduction, and a Cryptographic Verification Stage using AOT costing for the more resource-intensive cryptographic operations. This enhances the network's user experience by allowing more efficient transaction processing within blocks, benefiting miners, developers, and users.
