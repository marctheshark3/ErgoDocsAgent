Ergomixer's income (in ERG and other tokens) is currently received by its creator, aka 'anon2020s', since it has only one stakeholder at the moment. He has announced that he is willing to create and sell some tokens in the near future to obtain more stakeholders; let's call this token MIX. Later, anyone having the MIX tokens can stake these tokens in the Profit Sharing contract and obtain the mixer's incomes proportional to their staked tokens.",
