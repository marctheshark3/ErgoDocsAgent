It includes parameters for state type, extra index, block and transaction verification, mining configuration, memory pool management, and more. ## State Type\n```conf\nstateType = \"utxo\"\n```\nThe `stateType` setting sets the type of state the node maintains. Possible options are `utxo`, where the node keeps a full utxo set allowing it to validate arbitrary blocks and generate ADProofs, and `digest`, where the node only keeps the state root hash and validates transactions via ADProofs.\n\n## Extra Index\n```conf\nextraIndex = false\nextraCacheSize = 500\n```\nThe `extraIndex` setting, if set to true, allows the node to store all transactions, boxes, and addresses in an index. `extraCacheSize` sets the number of recently used extra indexes kept in memory.",
