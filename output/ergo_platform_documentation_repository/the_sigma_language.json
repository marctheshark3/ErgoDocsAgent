Also, a hard fork would be required to add new cryptographic primitives, such as ring signatures.\nGeneralizing the Bitcoin Script, ErgoScript compiler and ErgoTree interpreter implement an authentication language which allows developers to specify coin spending conditions. The ErgoScript Compiler compiles the source code into ErgoTree byte code, which can be saved in UTXO coins to protect their spending (same as in Bitcoin).\nErgoTree, in turn, is a bytecode language and memory representation that can be deterministically interpreted in the given blockchain context.\n/// admonition | Please note\nErgoTree defines guarding proposition for a coin as a logic formula which combines predicates over a context and cryptographic statements provable via \u03a3-protocols with AND, OR, k-out-of-n connectives.\n///"
