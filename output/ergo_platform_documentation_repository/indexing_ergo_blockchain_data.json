      "content": "Performance: Querying a pre-built index (e.g., a database) is typically much faster than repeatedly querying the node's API, especially for complex lookups.\nData Aggregation: Indexers can aggregate data across multiple blocks or transactions (e.g., calculate total volume for a token, track historical balances).\nCustom Data Structures: You can structure the indexed data precisely how your application needs it, simplifying application logic.\nReduced Node Load: Offloads complex queries from the Ergo node."

      "heading": "Indexing Strategies Overview",
      "content": "There are three primary approaches to accessing indexed blockchain data:\nUsing Public Explorer APIs: Leverage the APIs provided by public blockchain explorers. Easiest to start, but relies on third parties and has limitations.\nQuerying Your Own Node's API Directly: Run your own node and query its REST API. Offers control but node APIs aren't optimized for complex queries.\nBuilding a Custom Indexer with SDKs: Develop a dedicated service to process blocks from your node and store relevant data in an optimized database. Most flexible and performant, but requires significant development effort."
