Other registers hold data associated with that state.\nTransitions: The ErgoScript guarding the state box defines the valid transitions. It checks:\nThe conditions required to move from the current state (e.g., specific inputs provided, signatures, blockchain height).\nThat the output box correctly represents the next valid state (e.g., the state identifier in R4 is updated correctly, other registers are preserved or updated according to protocol rules).\n\n\nImmutability: Each transaction creates a new box for the next state, preserving the immutable nature of the blockchain. The previous state box is consumed (spent)."

The output box must be in the Paid state.\nPaid -> Locked: Requires a transaction input signaling item dispensing (e.g., signed by the vendor). The output box must return to the Locked state, potentially with changed value (representing dispensed item cost).\nImplementation Sketch (ErgoScript):\n```scala\n// --- Script for a box in the 'Locked' state (State 0) ---\n{\n  // Constants defined: requiredPayment (Long), vendorPk (SigmaProp)\n  // R4[Int] stores the state identifier (0 for Locked)\nval currentState = SELF.R4[Int].getOrElse(-1) // Get current state ID\n// Transition 1: Payment Received\n  val paymentCondition = sigmaProp(\n    // Check if exactly one output exists\n    OUTPUTS.size == 1 &&\n    // Check if the input box value matches the required payment\n    INPUTS(0).value >= requiredPayment &&\n    // Check if the output box represents the 'Paid' state (State 1)\n    OUTPUTS(0).R4[Int].getOrElse(-1) == 1 &&\n    // Ensure the output script is the same (points back to this FSM logic)\n    OUTPUTS(0).propositionBytes == SELF.propositionBytes &&\n    // Ensure vendor PK is preserved (example of preserving data)\n    OUTPUTS(0).R5[SigmaProp].getOrElse(sigmaProp(false)) == SELF.R5[SigmaProp].getOrElse(sigmaProp(false)) &&\n    // Ensure output value reflects payment minus potential change logic (simplified here)\n    OUTPUTS(0).value >= requiredPayment\n  )\n// Allow vendor to reclaim funds anytime (example of another path)\n  val reclaimCondition = vendorPk\nsigmaProp(currentState == 0) && (paymentCondition || reclaimCondition)\n}\n// --- Script for a box in the 'Paid' state (State 1) ---\n{\n  // Constants defined: vendorPk (SigmaProp)\n  // R4[Int] stores the state identifier (1 for Paid)\nval currentState = SELF.R4[Int].getOrElse(-1) ..."

This approach allows for more complex state transitions while maintaining efficiency.\nAs described in the \"Advanced ErgoScript Tutorial,\" we can emulate long-lived contracts by creating new boxes with the same script. While the box ID will change, the contract logic persists across state transitions.\nImplementing robust FSMs requires careful planning of states, transitions, and the data that needs to be preserved or updated in registers at each step."
