      "content": "SigUSD is over-collateralised; every sigusd is backed by 3$ currently. Everyone can see that there is money in the bank, which stops a bank's run at its inception. The breaking point of the peg is explicit and open for anyone to see. With UST, you have no idea, which gives you an incentive to get out first.\nLuna supply depends on terra usage; Ergo does not. Burning luna when the trend is up pumps its price. However, the luna price will dump harder when the trend is down because more luna is printed. \n\n\ncollateral ratio for sigusd is higher. This means that the capital efficiency (less collateral tied for each stablecoin) is better for terra, which is why luna/terra can offer a better yield.\nHowever, this means luna/terra needs an additional mechanism to ensure stability. When collateral (luna) value drops, someone needs to stabilise it. Those people are incentivised with promises of larger profits in the future. This assumes that people will always believe that the protocol survives the crash. No one knows at which price point luna the trust disappears. This creates a seed for a bank run. Everyone wants to take their stablecoin out faster than others if there is any doubt.\nIn contrast, sigusd shows explicitly when the peg will be lost. No one needs to guess how long the protocol can last."

The reason for this is the vulnerability of CDP-based protocols in terms of high volatility and blockchain congestion.As Emurgo states, \u201cBlack Thursday,\u201d when MakerDAO CDPs were triggered for liquidation due to volatility and then sold for $0 due to blockchain congestion that prevented others from bidding, demonstrated that a new design is needed. For AgeUSD, this scenario is not possible.\nFor those unfamiliar with the MakerDAO system, the entire project is centred around the governance, growth and expansion of the Dai ecosystem. While Ether  and Basic Attention Token are currently the only forms of collateral supported to mint Dai, it\u2019s common knowledge that Maker will gradually introduce new collateral types over the course of the next few years.\nMaker provides an innovate mechanism for users to further leverage their belief in cryptocurrencies. Unlike fiat-collateralized stablecoins which use centralized reserves to retain custody of the fiat used to create new tokens, Maker\u2019s system leverages smart contracts to hold the underlying system in escrow."

It features considerable similarities with the deprecated, single-collateral DAI by MakerDAO. Users could deposit Ether in a \u2018safe,\u2019 just like DAI vaults. The minimum collateralization rate in the case of this example in algorithmic stablecoins list is just below 150%. Users would receive RAI tokens in return. The algorithm of RAI features a dedicated PID controller, which receives an input of the existing price of RAI. Then, it makes adjustments in the supply according to the price by following a continuous feedback loop.\nMost importantly, all the parameters are hard-coded in the algorithm alongside ensuring responsive, automatic reactions to market data without direct manual intervention. Apart from the value benefit of \u2018self-peg,\u2019 RAI presents considerable differences from DAI in terms of governance. It aims to take various parameters of governance out of the process in 2022, thereby reducing the need for depending on governance."

      "content": "FEI is also another notable protocol you could find in an algorithmic stablecoins list. It focuses on addressing the capital inefficiencies identified in the case of stablecoins such as DAI. FEI presents stark differences in comparison to other algorithm-based stablecoins. One of the foremost differences refers to the fact that it does not feature the mechanism for swapping collateral for stablecoin. On the contrary, digital wealth comes into the system by leveraging a bonding curve, which sells FEI in exchange for ETH. Then, the digital wealth remains locked in the Protocol Controlled Value or PCV, which is basically the pool of collateral for the stablecoin.\nPCV helps in maintaining the peg by managing liquidity on exchanges like Uniswap. With the limitations on sell-side liquidity, FEI is one of the best algorithmic stablecoins for avoiding the \u2018death spiral\u2019 scenario. The FEI protocol leverages its TRIBE token for enabling holders to determine the following aspects of governance,"

It also uses seigniorage created by its minting operations as transaction stimulus, thereby facilitating adoption.\nPegged to the world\u2019s major currencies, Terra aims to be able to support a global payment network.\nThe team believes that a currency that cannot be used at checkout is useless.
