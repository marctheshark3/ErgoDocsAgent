      "heading": "Voting on Soft-Fork",
      "content": "To propose or vote on a soft-fork, the protocolVersion must be increased by one in a block header. Once this is done, the node will automatically propose a soft-fork (at the beginning of an epoch) or vote for it.\nAs an example, suppose you want to vote on changing the target value for storage fee factor (ID: 1) to 1000000, you would use the following configuration:\nbash\n1 = 1000000\nSetting any non-zero value will vote for the soft-fork, while setting it to zero votes against it. For instance, to vote against a proposed change with ID 120, you would set:\nbash\n120 = 0\nThe voting configurations allow for flexible network changes, promoting adaptability in the blockchain's operation as conditions or requirements change over time."
