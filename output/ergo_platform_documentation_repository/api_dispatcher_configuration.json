In actor-based systems, the dispatcher is responsible for the execution of messages from the actor's mailbox.\n\n## Dispatcher Type\n```conf\ntype = Dispatcher\n```\nThe `type` setting specifies the dispatcher type. In this configuration, `Dispatcher` is used, representing an event-based dispatcher. ## Executor Type\n```conf\nexecutor = \"fork-join-executor\"\n```\nThe `executor` setting determines the type of execution service used. Here, the `fork-join-executor` is utilized, which allows tasks to be split into smaller parts and executed concurrently, increasing efficiency.",
