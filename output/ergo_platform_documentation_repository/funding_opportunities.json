A Raffle not only provides a clear funding goal, but it also validates the community's support and can be supplemented by additional grant or foundation funding. For projects of a larger scale, multiple grant programs are at your disposal. You can seek funding through the [Good Whale Fund](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/13) or the [DarkFund0](https://github.com/ergoplatform/grow-ergo/issues/1). These platforms offer you the opportunity to introduce your project to the community, highlighting its potential impact and significance.",
