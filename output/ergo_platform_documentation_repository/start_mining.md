# Start Mining

This guide will walk you through the process of starting to mine Ergo using [Autolykos2](autolykos.md). ## Prerequisites

Before you start mining, make sure you have the following:

- Familiarity with Ergo. If you're new, start with [ What is Ergo?](why.md)
- A computer with at least one GPU that has more than 6GB of memory. Check the [Autolykos v2 hashrates spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NsuoDB27EwCo_BlSjCP3GMLfTSJRPIWIBsL-wPTllUg) for potential hashrates.

### Steps to Start Mining
Choose your preferred mining software. If you're using a dedicated rig, select an appropriate operating system.
Set up a wallet where your mining payouts will be deposited.
Select a mining pool to join or look into solo mining
Consider overclocking your GPU to maximize your mining performance. Be aware that this can increase power consumption and potentially shorten the lifespan of your hardware.
Check out the Miner Tooling and keep an eye on ways to participate in miner governance in future.
Happy mining!
