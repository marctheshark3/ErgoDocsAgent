You can make permissionless and trustless prediction markets about literally any data on the blockchain, and to prove who wins in the prediction all one has to do is make a tx with a specific utxo as a data-input, and you have trustless verificaition and payout. This is likely also expandable into trustless on-chain insurance as well.",
