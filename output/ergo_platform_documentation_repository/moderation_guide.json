From there, you can create new rules, define triggers (words, phrases, links, etc.), and specify the desired actions (delete message, warn user, kick/ban, etc.). Automod rules can be as simple or complex as needed, allowing for granular control over server moderation.\n/// admonition | Exclude members based on activity\n    type: warning\nThe spam rules are designed to be strict to catch potential abuse. However, this can sometimes lead to false positives for legitimate messages. To mitigate this issue, certain roles are excluded from the spam filters on the Ergo Discord server.\nOne approach is to use a service like engau.ge to assign new users a specific role once they reach a threshold number of messages. This role can then be excluded from the spam rules, allowing more active and engaged members to participate freely without triggering false positives.\n///"
