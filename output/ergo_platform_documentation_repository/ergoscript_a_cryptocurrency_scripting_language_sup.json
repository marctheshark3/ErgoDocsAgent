Programs in $\\langname$ are used to specify the conditions under which currency can be spent. The language supports a type of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs called $\\Sigma$-protocols and is flexible enough to allow for ring-signatures, multisignatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation. ## Introduction\n### Background\n\nSince its early days, Bitcoin[@Nak08] has allowed more than simple money transfers between two public keys: its Bitcoin Script scripting language has allowed participants to specify conditions for how money could be spent. A program written in Bitcoin Script is attached to every transaction output (i.e., amount received); this program protects the transaction by determining how the transaction output can be used as an input to (i.e., spent in) a future transaction.",

      "content": "Since its early days, Bitcoin[@Nak08] has allowed more than simple money transfers between two public keys: its Bitcoin Script scripting language has allowed participants to specify conditions for how money could be spent. A program written in Bitcoin Script is attached to every transaction output (i.e., amount received); this program protects the transaction by determining how the transaction output can be used as an input to (i.e., spent in) a future transaction. The simplest condition is specified by a program that contains the recipient's public key and states that the money can be spent by creating a signature that verifies under this key. However, more general conditions are allowed by more sophisticated programs.\nThe Bitcoin Script language is a primitive stack-based language without loops[@bscript]. To spend an output protected by a program, a spending transaction must provide a program in the same language, and the concatenation of the two programs must evaluate to true. The creator of the spending transaction can be viewed as a prover (for example, proving knowledge of the secret key by producing a signature), where the statement that needs to be proven is specified by the output that is being spent. Transaction validity is verified by evaluating programs. Bounded validation time is ensured by the absence of loops in the programming language and a maximum program size of 10 kilobytes. Even so, some denial-of-service attacks exploiting script validation time have appeared [@bitcoindos] [@fivehrs] [@ethattacks]. On the other hand, the deliberate simplicity of the programming language limits the kinds of contracts that can be created on the Bitcoin platform.\nOn other end of the generality spectrum, Ethereum allows for arbitrary Turing-complete programs[@wood2014ethereum]. This approach requires charging for computation, in order to prevent denial-of-service attacks, because the running time of a Turing-complete program cannot, in general, be estimated without..."

A box (often called a \"coin\" in other literature) contains some amount (value, measured in Ergo tokens) and is protected by a script (boxes also contain additional information, such as other tokens; this information is described in detail in Section Box Registers). A transaction spends the value of boxes that are its inputs (which are outputs of some earlier transaction) and produces boxes that are its outputs. In a given transaction, the sum of the values of the inputs must equal the sum of the values of the outputs (as we describe below, the scripting language is rich enough to allow for payment transactions fees and for minting of new coins without violating this rule).\nAll the unspent transaction outputs (UTXO) at a given time represent the value stored in the blockchain. A script for a box must evaluate to \"true\" when this box is used as an input to a transaction. This evaluation is helped by a proof (for $\\Sigma$-statements) and a context, which are part of the transaction. The proof is produced by someone who knows the relevant secrets, such as secret keys; the context contains information about the spending transaction, such as details of its inputs and outputs, and the current state of the blockchain, such as the current height of the blockchain and last 10 block headers from the blockchain."
