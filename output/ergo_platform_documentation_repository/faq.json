Potential risks if participants collaborate to generate fake proofs. | No \"ceremony\" setup required. Avoids risks associated with MPC setup. |\n| Decentralization | Operates on Ethereum; potential for centralization due to congestion, centralsied block production. | Focuses on decentralization to enhance privacy, discourages centralization tendencies. Incorporates innovative design for programmable money which enables a programmable mixer |\n| Blacklisting/Tracking | Vulnerable to blacklisting/tracking due to Proof-of-Stake. | Implements measures to prevent blacklisting/tracking, encourages node decentralization. |\n| Hosting and Developer | Developed by a known team. | Self-hosted and created by an anonymous developer. Adds an additional layer of privacy and security. |\nTornado.Cash uses zk-SNARKs, which requires a \"ceremony\" to generate parameters required by the zk-SNARKs algorithm itself. This  Multi-party-computation means if only one participant of the MPC setup was honest, all others could try to cheat, and it would be secure.\nHowever, if all participants cheated and cooperated, they would have the ability to generate fake proofs later, and nobody will know about..."
