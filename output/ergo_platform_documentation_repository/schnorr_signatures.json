Off-chain signature generation must ensure the response s (or z below) fits within this limit.\n```scala\n{\n    val message = ...\n    // Compute challenge\n    val e: Coll[Byte] = blake2b256(message)\n    val eInt = byteArrayToBigInt(e) // Challenge as big integer\n// Retrieve a of signature (a, z)\nval a = getVar .get\nval aBytes = a.getEncoded\n\n// Retrieve z of signature (a, z)\nval zBytes = getVar .get\nval z = byteArrayToBigInt(zBytes)\n\n// Verify signature by checking if g^z = a * Y^e\nval properSignature = g.exp(z) == a.multiply(holder.exp(eInt))\n\nsigmaProp(properSignature)\n}\n```"
