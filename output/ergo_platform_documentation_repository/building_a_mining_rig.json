It's responsible for solving the complex mathematical problems that validate transactions on the Ergo network.\nMotherboards (MOBO): The motherboard is the main circuit board of your mining rig. It's where all other components are connected.\nPower Supply (PSU): The power supply provides electricity to your mining rig. Make sure to choose a PSU with enough capacity to support all your components.\nProcessor (CPU): While not as important as the GPU for mining, the CPU handles the rest of your rig's operations.\nMemory (RAM): RAM is your rig's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data that your CPU uses while operating.\nStorage (USB, SSD, HDD): Your rig's storage is where the operating system and mining software are installed.\nOther Hardware\nGPU Risers: These allow you to connect multiple GPUs to your motherboard.\nCPU Cooler: This keeps your CPU's temperature down.\nMining Rack: A mining rack helps you organize your rig in a safe and efficient manner.\nFans: Fans are necessary to keep your rig's temperature down.\nOnce you've chosen your components, you can check the potential hashrate of your GPU here. This will give you an idea of how effective your rig will be at mining Ergo."
