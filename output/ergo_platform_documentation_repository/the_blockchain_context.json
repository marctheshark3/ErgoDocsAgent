Using this function allows your contract to gain insight into the most recent blocks before the current transaction's execution context. Each Header object in the collection returned by headers holds various information, much of which pertains to the block miner, such as the miner\u2019s public key (PK), the nonce used to find the block, and the votes the miner submitted when the block was mined."

The PreHeader object represents all the information available to miners attempting to find the next block. Because each block miner must insert their own information to properly mine a block, the data contained within each PreHeader object varies depending on who mines the block. This means your contract could execute differently depending on who mines the block containing the transaction that spends your contract\u2019s box."

It then combines these conditions into a final SigmaProp result that evaluates to true if either (amountAddedInOutputs && selfAtZero) or (heightIsValid && randomValueIsEven) is true."
