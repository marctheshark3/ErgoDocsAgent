Leaf nodes represent the hash of individual data elements, such as transactions, while non-leaf nodes represent the hash of their child nodes. The topmost node, known as the Merkle Root, serves as a cryptographic commitment to the entire dataset. This structure allows for efficient verification of data integrity, ensuring that even if only a small portion of the data is checked, the entire dataset can be trusted.\nmermaid\ngraph TD\n    A1[Transaction Hash 1] --> B1[Hash 1]\n    A2[Transaction Hash 2] --> B1\n    A3[Transaction Hash 3] --> B2[Hash 2]\n    A4[Transaction Hash 4] --> B2\n    B1 --> C[Parent Hash 1]\n    B2 --> C\n    C --> D[Merkle Root]"

      "heading": "Leaf Nodes",
      "content": "Each leaf node in the Merkle Tree represents a transaction and its corresponding spending proofs. The leaf node is a 64-byte data block, consisting of:\nA 32-byte transaction identifier (a 256-bit hash of the transaction)\nA 32-byte digest of the transaction's spending proofs\nThe leaf node hash is computed by concatenating a 1-byte prefix (used for domain separation), the position of the transaction within the block, and the 64-byte data block itself. The prefix for a leaf node is 0x00. This data is then hashed using the Blake2b256 hash function.\nCode Reference: The implementation of leaf node hashing can be found in the MerkleTree.scala file in the scrypto repository."

      "heading": "Internal Nodes",
      "content": "Internal nodes are constructed by hashing the concatenation of their two child nodes. The hash function used is the Blake2b256 cryptographic hash function. Internal nodes do not include keys in their hash inputs, optimizing proof sizes by focusing only on the hashes of child nodes.\nTo construct an internal node, the following steps are taken:\nConcatenate: Combine the 1-byte prefix for internal nodes (0x01) with the hashes of the left and right child nodes.\nHash: Apply the Blake2b256 function to the concatenated result to produce the hash for the internal node.\nCode Reference:  The code for internal node construction is also part of the MerkleTree.scala file in the scrypto repository."

      "heading": "Merkle Root",
      "content": "The Merkle Root is the final hash at the top of the Merkle Tree. It is computed by recursively hashing the tree from the leaf nodes up to the root. The Merkle Root serves as a cryptographic commitment to all the transactions included in the block, ensuring that any tampering with the data can be detected.\nIn Ergo, the Merkle Root is included in the block header, providing a way for nodes to efficiently verify the integrity of the entire block by only checking the root hash.\nCode Reference: The Merkle Root calculation and its inclusion in the block header are managed in the BlockTransactions.scala file in the Ergo repository."

      "heading": "Merkle Proof Encoding",
      "content": "Merkle proofs in Ergo are encoded in a specific format to enable efficient verification. A Merkle proof provides the necessary data to verify that a particular leaf node is part of the Merkle Tree.\nThe encoding consists of the following elements:\n1-byte prefix: Indicates whether the computed value (hash) is on the right (0x01) or the left (0x00) side of the node.\n32-byte stored value: This is the sibling hash for the current node. The proof provides the path of sibling hashes from the leaf to the root, allowing the verifier to recompute the root hash.\nWhen verifying a proof, the verifier reconstructs the path from the leaf node to the Merkle Root using the provided sibling hashes and the original leaf hash. If the computed root matches the expected Merkle Root, the proof is valid.\nCode Reference: The BatchMerkleProof class, handling Merkle proof generation and verification, is implemented in the BatchMerkleProof.scala file."
