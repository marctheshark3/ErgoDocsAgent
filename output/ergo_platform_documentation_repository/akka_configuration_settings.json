      "content": "conf\nrequest-timeout = 1 minute\nThe request-timeout setting specifies the maximum duration the server will wait for a request to be completed before it times out. In this configuration, the timeout is set to 1 minute. This setting is crucial to prevent the system from waiting indefinitely for a response, which could impact performance or availability."

In this configuration, the limit is set to 128 connections. This ensures the server can handle multiple requests simultaneously without overloading its resources."

In this configuration, the limit is set to 8192 characters. This setting is crucial to prevent potential buffer overflow attacks and keep the server secure."

Adjust these settings carefully, considering both your application's requirements and potential risks."
