### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure the following:
Knowledge and Tools:

Basic understanding of the Ergo blockchain and grid trading strategies.
Familiarity with Rust programming language and CLI tools.



Environment Setup:

Installed Rust and Cargo (Rust's package manager).
Configured Ergo node and wallet. Follow Ergo Node Setup and Wallet Guide.



Nix Installation (Optional):

For easier building and execution, install Nix.

### Overview of Off-the-Grid
Off-the-Grid enables decentralized, automated grid trading on the Ergo blockchain, providing features such as:
Secure contract-based trading ensuring order safety.
Off-chain bots for order tracking and execution.
Compatibility with Spectrum AMM for liquidity matching.
Limitations:
Contracts are not audited—exercise caution with significant assets.
Profits are not guaranteed, and risks depend on market conditions.

#### 1. Clone and Build the Repository
Clone the Repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Telefragged/off-the-grid.git
cd off-the-grid


Build with Cargo or Nix:


With Nix: (Recommended for simplicity)
bash
nix build
The executable is placed in ./result/bin/off-the-grid.


With Cargo:
bash
cargo build --release
The executable is in ./target/release/off-the-grid.

#### 2. Node Setup
Node Configuration:
Update the node_config.json file with:

api_url: Your Ergo node's API URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:9053).
api_key: API key from your Ergo node.

Example:
json
{
    "api_url": "http://127.0.0.1:9053",
    "api_key": "your-wallet-api-key"
}


Set Up Wallet:
Follow the Ergo wallet setup guide. Ensure the wallet is initialized and synchronized.


Generate Scans Configuration:
Run the following command to generate scan_config.json:
bash
off-the-grid scans create-config
To include all existing boxes, add --rescan to the command.

#### 3. Fetch Token Information (Optional)
For better usability, update the token list:
bash
off-the-grid tokens update
This fetches token details from Spectrum's API and saves them locally.

#### 4. Create Grid Orders
Define a Grid Order:
Use the grid create command to specify trading parameters:
bash
off-the-grid grid create -t <token_name> -v <total_value> -o <num_orders> -r <high>-<low> -i <grid_id>

<token_name>: Name of the token to trade.
<total_value>: Total Ergo value for the grid.
<num_orders>: Number of grid orders.
<high> and <low>: Price range for the grid.
<grid_id>: Unique identifier for the grid.

Example:
bash
off-the-grid grid create -t COMET -v 10 -o 50 -r 50000-100000 -i comet


Confirm Transaction:
After generating the grid order, review and confirm using on-screen prompts.

#### 5. Manage and Monitor Grids
List Active Grids:
bash
off-the-grid grid list
This command displays all active grids with details like bid/ask prices and profit.


View Grid Details:
bash
off-the-grid grid details -i <grid_id>
Replace <grid_id> with the grid's unique identifier.


Redeem Grid Orders:
Close or redeem grid orders with:
bash
off-the-grid grid redeem -i <grid_id>

#### 6. Run the Matching Bot
Configure Matcher:
Set up the reward address in matcher_config.json:
json
{
    "reward_address": "your_reward_address"
}
Alternatively, use an environment variable:
bash
export MATCHER_REWARD_ADDRESS="your_reward_address"


Start the Matcher:
bash
off-the-grid matcher
The bot logs successful transactions and errors. Multiple matchers may compete for transactions, so occasional failures are expected.

#### 7. Optimize and Analyze
Performance Monitoring:
Check logs to identify issues or opportunities for improvement:
bash
off-the-grid logs tail


Experiment with Parameters:
Test various configurations to find optimal settings for market conditions.


Integrate Analytics:
Use tools like Spectrum to track market trends and evaluate the bot's performance.

### Best Practices
Security: Safeguard your API keys and wallet credentials.


Caution: Avoid over-investing in untested strategies or assets.


Stay Updated: Keep the bot, tokens, and configs up-to-date with regular updates.
