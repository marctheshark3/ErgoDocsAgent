This improves the user experience by making it easier to send and receive transactions using memorable names instead of long, complex addresses. ## Key Features\n\n- Register unique names on the Ergo blockchain\n- Associate registered names with Ergo addresses\n- Resolve registered names to their corresponding addresses\n- Support for subnames (e.g., alice.example)\n- Decentralized and censorship-resistant\n- Open-source and community-driven\n\nErgoNames is an important project for improving the usability and adoption of the Ergo ecosystem. By providing a user-friendly naming system, it reduces the friction of using Ergo addresses and enables a better overall experience for users.",
