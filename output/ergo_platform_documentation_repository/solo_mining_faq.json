To make these funds visible in your wallet, you need to transfer all the funds to your own address in the node wallet. Once the transfer is confirmed on the chain, the Explorer will display them. ## Why Do My Rewards Go to a Different Address?",

These scripts lock the rewards to the miner's public keys for 720 blocks. You can see an example of such a script here.\nThese UTXOs are not part of the node wallet before the locking height, so they are not included in your balance. However, they are stored in a special node application with id = 9 (wallet application id = 10). You can locate them via the /scan/unspentBoxes/9 API endpoint.\nAfter 720 confirmations, the wallet will display the mined rewards, even if they are still associated with long scripts instead of short P2PK addresses."
