We welcome all insights and contributions. ## Current Focus\n\nWith the successful integration of UTXO set snapshots and Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs) for ultra-fast bootstrapping in the pruned full node, our focus has now shifted towards optimizing this implementation. We are also exploring ways to further increase block limits for miners, given the live status of the pruned full node. ## Recent Developments\n\n- (TBA) Planning for Node V6 & scalability improvements\n- (WIP) Development of SPV Client\n- Pruned Full Node is [now live](pruned-full-node.md)\n- Release of [Node V5](jitc.md)\n- GetBlok released the [Plasma Library](plasma.md)\n- Plasma Tutorials have been published\n\n## Roadmaps\n\n### Ergo Design and Implementation Roadmap",
