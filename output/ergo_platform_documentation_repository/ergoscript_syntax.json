      "heading": "ErgoScript and the UTXO Model",
      "content": "Ergo operates on the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model and employs a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. However, Ergo enhances the traditional UTXO model with its extended-UTXO model, which supports the execution of intricate financial contracts, similar to those possible on Ethereum's account-based model.\nKey concepts of ErgoScript related to the UTXO model include:\nBox: A Box is essentially a UTXO in Ergo and can store data across up to ten registers. Like Bitcoin, Ergo transactions consume one or more existing boxes (represented by the INPUTS array) and produce one or more new boxes (represented by the OUTPUTS array).\nUTXO-Specific Constructs: ErgoScript incorporates constructs like Box, INPUTS, and OUTPUTS that are specific to the UTXO model. The LangSpec.md document provides a comprehensive list of these constructs.\nTuring Completeness: Although ErgoScript itself is not Turing complete, you can still build Turing-complete applications, as detailed in this peer-reviewed paper."

      "heading": "ErgoScript Syntax Overview",
      "content": "ErgoScript\u2019s syntax is derived from Scala, but you don\u2019t need to be a Scala expert to write ErgoScript. The language uses a minimal subset of Scala\u2019s features, focusing on simplicity and functionality:\nImmutable Values: In ErgoScript, you define values using val, ensuring immutability (similar to constants in other languages). Unlike Scala, ErgoScript does not support the var keyword, meaning all defined values are immutable.\nArray Access: Both Scala and ErgoScript use round parentheses for array access. For example, OUTPUTS(0) refers to the first element of the OUTPUTS array.\nFunctional Programming: ErgoScript supports functional programming constructs such as foreach, exists, and fold, making it easier to work with collections. More details on these can be found in the ErgoScript Compiler Documentation.\nBoolean Predicates: ErgoScript programs, like ErgoTree, consist of sequences of boolean predicates connected using && (AND) and || (OR).\nCryptographic Operations: ErgoScript supports cryptographic operations with BigInt and GroupElement types, allowing for addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. Note that BigInt operations in ErgoScript are performed modulo 2^256, so overflow management is crucial."

Specifying the type is optional but recommended for clarity.\n= true: Assigns the value true to bool."
