You can find a list of such pools on Mining Pool Stats.\n\n\nHost Your Own Pool: If you prefer to have complete control over your mining process, you can set up and host your own mining pool. Our pool setup guide provides detailed instructions on how to do this.\nRemember, solo mining requires a good understanding of the mining process and a significant amount of resources. Make sure to thoroughly evaluate your options before you start.\n/// admonition | Remember EIP-27!\n    type: warning\nTo be able to spend any ERG mined via the reference client, you will need to include the EIP27 rules in your ergo.conf.
