# Ergo's Storage Rent System

*(Back to: [Protocol Overview](protocol-overview.md))*

Ergo's design prioritizes long-term economic sustainability. One of the key strategies we've implemented to ensure this is the concept of **Storage Rent**. This can be likened to an *'on-chain garbage collection'* mechanism that not only mitigates the issue of blockchain bloat but also turns it into a profitable venture for [miners](mining-overview.md). Storage rent is a minimal fee levied on [unspent output (UTXOs)](eutxo.md) or '[boxes](box.md)' after a period of four years of inactivity.

## Ergo's Storage Rent System
(Back to: Protocol Overview)
Ergo's design prioritizes long-term economic sustainability. One of the key strategies we've implemented to ensure this is the concept of Storage Rent. This can be likened to an 'on-chain garbage collection' mechanism that not only mitigates the issue of blockchain bloat but also turns it into a profitable venture for miners.
Storage rent is a minimal fee levied on unspent output (UTXOs) or 'boxes' after a period of four years of inactivity. The fee per byte is determined by the storage rent subprotocol. On average, this amounts to approximately 0.14 ERG every four years for a typical box.
