      "heading": "Monster Collection and NFTs",
      "content": "One of the most exciting aspects of Project Tesseract is the use of NFTs for each monster. This means that every monster is unique and can be owned, sold, or traded on the blockchain. Players will have the opportunity to collect various kinds of monsters, each with its own set of attributes and abilities."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Open Source Development",
      "content": "ErgoGames.io will open-source Project Tesseract's game code on Github, making it possible for the community to follow the development progress closely. This move signifies the team\u2019s commitment to transparency and community involvement."

    {
      "heading": "Interoperability with Ephemeral Bridge",
      "content": "Project Tesseract will utilize ErgoGames.io's Ephemeral Bridge technology. This tool bridges data between a player's Nautilus wallet and their local device, pulling NFT data directly without requiring the game to be hosted on a website. Essentially, the Ephemeral Bridge will enable seamless interaction between the blockchain and the gaming environment."

      "heading": "Discord Integration",
      "content": "The game will also feature Discord integration, allowing real-time communication between players and facilitating the announcement of in-game events and player achievements. The Discord integration is still in the Beta stage but has shown promising results in early testing."
