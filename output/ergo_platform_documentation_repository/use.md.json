Ergo has a vision for what the sector can become. *\n\n2020 is shaping up to be the year in which [Decentralised Finance](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2020-07-02-ergo-and-the-explosion-of-defi/) rose to mainstream attention, in the same way that Bitcoin and blockchain did in 2016 and 2017. In July alone, Total Value Locked \u2013 the amount of funds committed to DeFi dApps\u2019 smart contracts \u2013 doubled from $2 billion to $4 billion, largely driven by Compound\u2019s distribution of its COMP governance tokens.",

      "content": "As Eric Hughes wrote in A Cypherpunk\u2019s Manifesto back in 1993, \u2018Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.\u2019 That is never more true than for financial privacy. Privacy must be a built-in feature of DeFi \u2013 not a bolt on extra or a desirable feature. It must be integral.\nBut, as Hughes continues, \u2018Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.\u2019 There is always a balance to be struck between privacy and compliance, between transparency and anonymity. Large scale adoption of DeFi requires auditability, and the regulatory approval that enables.\nThanks to the latest advances in zero-knowledge proofs, Ergo can offer both privacy and transparency, where required. The platform\u2019s Sigma Protocols offer robust, customisable cryptography \u2013 and, at the same time, the ability to selectively reveal information where necessary."

      "heading": "Scalability",
      "content": "The ability to process thousands of transactions per second is also a non-negotiable feature for a thriving DeFi sector. How this is achieved is less important than that it is achieved; in practice, there will be many different approaches, with different users and protocols selecting the ones they prefer.\nFor example, while we have seen the rise of sidechains and child chains, the reality is that exchanges remain a gateway to the blockchain world for a large proportion of users. Popular exchanges are increasingly integrating DeFi functionality, allowing their vast user bases to access it from their individual accounts, without interacting directly with the protocol.\nWhile this may be less than ideal from a security perspective, it\u2019s a simple reality that centralised services are not going out of fashion, but are integrating decentralised technologies thanks to the advantages they offer. Ergo has its own approach to scalability, but we can\u2019t and won\u2019t ignore the importance of businesses in driving forward user adoption."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Interoperability",
      "content": "One of DeFi\u2019s key strengths is composability: the ability to build new applications from existing components, leveraging the network effect of established dApps and tokens. This is one of the main factors that has enabled TVL to explode over the past month.\nBut composability currently has its limits. Cross-platform composability currently isn\u2019t possible. Even atomic swaps \u2013 the first stage of interoperability \u2013 are in their infancy, though Ergo is working on an atomic swap-powered DEX.\nFull interoperability means the ability for a user to execute a smart contract on one platform and have it seamlessly interact with another blockchain. This would allow truly frictionless cross-protocol interaction, and is what is needed to enable the flow of liquidity fully throughout the DeFi world. At that point, applications become blockchain agnostic, and the platforms are really more like the programming languages for accessing dApps\u2019 functionality."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Decentralisation",
      "content": "Lastly, and specifically in the context of scalability and interoperability, we cannot forget the importance of decentralisation \u2013 something Ergo has always taken seriously.\nOf course DeFi is decentralised \u2013 but there are different types of decentralisation. Ethereum, the home of almost every major DeFi dApp, is just one platform.\nEthereum\u2019s developers are working on a plan for scaling, but even if this is successful, it is still one blockchain. Should we entrust all our funds to one network? What if a critical bug or exploit is found?\nInteroperability does more than enable cross-chain liquidity. It decentralises the decentralised infrastructure for DeFi, adding layers of redundancy and security. In the process, it strengthens every blockchain that is a part of that ecosystem, creating a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. At a time when relatively large blockchains still suffer double spend attacks and serious reorgs, and catastrophic vulnerabilities are found in smart contracts holding tens of millions of dollars of value, we cannot assume that one single blockchain will or should rule them all."
