It utilizes the capabilities of GraalVM, offering a broad spectrum of [features](protocol-overview.md) to [streamline the development process](get-started.md). The [Ergo AppKit](appkit.md) acts as a compact interface to the core elements of the [ErgoScript interpreter](sigmastate-interpreter.md) and [Ergo protocol implementations](protocol-overview.md), both of which are developed in [Scala](scala.md). This setup enables Java developers to engage with the Ergo's [foundational infrastructure](protocol-overview.md) without the necessity to explore the Scala codebase. Alternatively, direct interaction with the core [Rust implementation](rust.md) is possible via [Java (JNI) bindings for sigma-rust](sigma-rust.md#bindings).",
