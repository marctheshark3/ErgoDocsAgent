These regular online hackathons bring together developers, designers, students, and enthusiasts from around globe onto the [Ergo Discord](https://discord.gg/qxdrHM2eHv). Participants collaborate intensively, often over several days or weeks, to build solutions, tools, and dApps that address specific themes or contribute broadly to the Ergo ecosystem. Originally conceived as competitions, ERGOHACKs have evolved into powerful incubators for talent and technology.",
