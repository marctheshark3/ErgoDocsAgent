ErgoScript is a language to write contracts for [Ergo blockchain](https://ergoplatform.org). ErgoScript contracts can be compiled to [ErgoTrees](ergotree.md), [serialized](serialization.md) and stored in UTXOs. A good starting point to writing contracts is to use [ErgoScript by Example](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example) with [Ergo Playgrounds](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds) or [Appkit](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-appkit). The ErgoScript compiler is [published](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scorexfoundation/sigma-state)
as a library which is cross compiled for Java 7 and Java 8+ and can be used from any JVM lanugage, Android or JavaFX.

#### Introduction
ErgoScript is a language to write contracts for Ergo blockchain. ErgoScript contracts can be compiled to ErgoTrees, serialized and stored in UTXOs.
A good starting point to writing contracts is to use ErgoScript by Example with Ergo Playgrounds or Appkit.
The ErgoScript compiler is published
as a library which is cross compiled for Java 7 and Java 8+ and can be used from any JVM lanugage, Android or JavaFX.
The following example shows how source code of ErgoScript contract can be used to create new transaction using Appkit, see FreezeCoin.java for more details.
```scala
// To create transaction we use a builder obtained from the context
// the builder keeps relationship with the context to access necessary blockchain data.
UnsignedTransactionBuilder txB = ctx.newTxBuilder();
// create new box using new builder obtained from the transaction builder
// in this case we compile new ErgoContract from source ErgoScript code
OutBox newBox = txB.outBoxBuilder()
        .value(amountToPay)
        .contract(ctx.compileContract(
                ConstantsBuilder.create()
                        .item("freezeDeadline", ctx.getHeight() + newBoxDelay)
                        .item("pkOwner", prover.getP2PKAddress().pubkey())
                        .build(),
                "{ " +
                "  val deadlinePassed = sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline)" +
                "  deadlinePassed && pkOwner " +
                "}"))
        .build();
```
The contract is given as the string literal which contains the block of val declarations followed by the logical expression. The expression defines the all possible conditions to spend the box. The contract can also contain named
constants (which cannot be represented as literals in the source code).
In the example freezeDeadline and pkOwner are named constants. The concrete values of named constants should be given to the compiler (see compileContract method)
**The following sections describe ErgoScript and its operations. **

##### ErgoScript language features overview
Syntax borrowed from Scala
Standard syntax and semantics for well known constructs (operations, code blocks, if branches etc.)
High-order language with first-class lambdas which are used in collection operations
Call-by-value (eager evaluation)
Statically typed with local type inference
Blocks are expressions 
Semicolon inference in blocks
Type constructors: Pair, Coll, Option

##### Operations and constructs overview
Binary operations: >, <, >=, <=, +, -, &&, ||, ==, !=, |, &, *, /, %, ^, ++
Predefined primitives: blake2b256, byteArrayToBigInt, proveDlog etc. 
Val declarations: val h = blake2b256(pubkey)
If-then-else clause: if (x > 0) 1 else 0
Collection literals: Coll(1, 2, 3, 4)
Generic high-order collection operations: map, filter, fold, exists, forall, etc.
Accessing fields of any predefined types: box.value
Method invocation for predefined types: coll.map({ x => x + 1 })
Function invocations (predefined and user defined): proveDlog(pubkey) 
User defined function declarations: def isProven(pk: GroupElement) = proveDlog(pk).isProven
Lambdas and high-order methods: OUTPUTS.exists { (out: Box) => out.value >= minToRaise }

##### Data types
In ErgoScript, everything is an object in the sense that we can call member functions and properties on any variable.
Some of the types can have a special internal representation - for example, numbers and booleans can be
represented as primitive values at runtime - but to the user they look like ordinary classes.
NOTE: in ErgoScript we use type, class and trait as synonyms, we prefer type when talking about primitive values and
trait or class when talking about methods.
Type Name        |   Description
-----------------|------------------------------
Any            | a supertype of any other type (not used directly in ErgoScript)
Unit           | a type with a single value ()
Boolean        | a type with two logical values true and false
Byte           | 8 bit signed integer
Short          | 16 bit signed integer
Int            | 32 bit signed integer
Long           | 64 bit signed integer
BigInt         | 256 bit signed integer
SigmaProp      | a type representing a sigma proposition which can be verified by executing a Sigma protocol with zero-knowledge proof of knowledge. Every contract should return a value of this type.
AvlTree        | represents a digest of authenticated dynamic dictionary and can be used to verify proofs of operations performed on the dictionary
GroupElement   | elliptic curve points
Box            | a box containing a monetary value (in NanoErgs), tokens and registers along with a guarding proposition
Option[T]      | a container which either have some value of type T or none.
Coll[T]        | a collection of arbitrary length with all values of type T
(T1,T2)        | a pair of values where T1, T2 can be different types
The type constructors Coll, (_,_) can be used to construct complex
types as in the following example.
scala
{
  val keyValues = OUTPUTS(0).R4[Coll[(Int, (Byte, Long))]].get
  ...
}

##### Literal syntax and Constants
Literals are used to introduce values of some types directly in program text
like in the following example:
scala
val unit: Unit = ()       // unit constant
val long: Int = 10        // interger value literal
val bool: Boolean = true  // logical literal
val arr = Coll(1, 2, 3)   // constructs a collection with given items
val str = "abc"           // string of characters
Note that many types don't have literal syntax and their values are introduced 
by applying operations, for example deserialize function can be used to introduce
a constant of any type by using Base64 encoded string (See predefined function).

##### Primitive Types
Below we specify methods of pre-defined types using Scala-like declaration of classes.
Note, the Boolean type doesn't have pre-defined methods in addition to the standard operations.
Note, ErgoScript doesn't allow to define new class types, however it has many pre-defined classes with methods defined below.
Every numeric type has the following methods.
```scala
/ Base supertype for all numeric types. */
class Numeric {
  / Convert this Numeric value to Byte. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   */
  def toByte: Byte
/* Convert this Numeric value to Short. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   /
  def toShort: Short
/* Convert this Numeric value to Int. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   /
  def toInt: Int
/* Convert this Numeric value to Long. 
   * @throws ArithmeticException if overflow happens. 
   /
  def toLong: Long
/* Convert this Numeric value to BigInt. /
  def toBigInt: BigInt
}
```
All the predefined numeric types inherit Numeric class and its methods.
They can be thought of as being pre-defined, like the following.
scala 
class Byte extends Numeric
class Short extends Numeric
class Int extends Numeric
class Long extends Numeric
class BigInt extends Numeric

##### Context Data
Every script is executed in a context, which is a collection of data available
for operations in the script. The context data is available using the CONTEXT
variable which is of pre-defined class Context which is shown below.
There are also shortcut variables which are available in every script to
simplify access to the most commonly used context data.
Variable          |  Type               | Shortcut for ...
------------------|---------------------|----------------------
HEIGHT          | Int               | CONTEXT.HEIGHT
SELF            | Box               | CONTEXT.SELF
INPUTS          | Coll[Box]         | CONTEXT.INPUTS
OUTPUTS         | Coll[Box]         | CONTEXT.OUTPUTS
The following listing shows the methods of pre-defined Context, Header,
PreHeader types.
``scala
/** Represents data available in ErgoScript usingCONTEXT` global variable /
class Context {
  / Height (block number) of the block which is currently being validated. /
  def HEIGHT: Int
/* Box whose proposition is being currently executing /
  def SELF: Box
/* Zero based index in inputs of selfBox /
  def selfBoxIndex: Int
/* A collection of inputs of the current transaction, the transaction where
    * selfBox is one of the inputs. 
    /
  def INPUTS: Coll[Box]
/* A collection of data inputs of the current transaction. Data inputs are
    * not going to be spent and thus don't participate in transaction validation
    * as INPUTS, but data boxes are available in guarding propositions of
    * INPUTS and thus can be used in spending logic.
    /
  def dataInputs: Coll[Box]
/* A collection of outputs of the current transaction. /
  def OUTPUTS: Coll[Box]
/* Authenticated dynamic dictionary digest representing Utxo state before
    * current state. 
    /
  def LastBlockUtxoRootHash: AvlTree
/* A fixed number of last block headers in descending order (first header is
    * the newest one) /
  def headers: Coll[Header]
/ Fields of a new block header, that can be predicted by a miner before block'...

##### Box type
Box represents a unit of storage in Ergo blockchain. It contains 10 registers
(indexed 0-9). First 4 are mandatory and the others are optional.
```scala
/ Representation of Ergo boxes used during execution of ErgoTree operations. */
class Box {
  / Box monetary value in NanoErg */
  def value: Long
/* Blake2b256 hash of this box's content, basically equals to
    * blake2b256(bytes)
/
  def id: Coll[Byte]
/* Serialized bytes of guarding script, which should be evaluated to true in
    * order to open this box. 
    /
  def propositionBytes: Coll[Byte]
/* Serialized bytes of this box's content, including proposition bytes. /
  def bytes: Coll[Byte]
/* Serialized bytes of this box's content, excluding transactionId and index
    * of output. 
    /
  def bytesWithoutRef: Coll[Byte]
/* If tx is a transaction which generated this box, then creationInfo._1
    * is a height of the tx's block. The creationInfo._2 is a serialized
    * transaction identifier followed by box index in the transaction outputs.
    /
  def creationInfo: (Int, Coll[Byte])
/* Synonym of R2 obligatory register /
  def tokens: Coll[(Coll[Byte], Long)]
/* Extracts register by id and type.
    * ErgoScript is typed, so accessing a register is an operation which involves some
    * expected type given in brackets. Thus SELF.R4[Int] expression should evaluate to a
    * valid value of the Option[Int] type.
    *
    * For example val x = SELF.R4[Int] expects the
    * register, if it is present, to have type Int. At runtime the corresponding type
    * descriptor is passed as implicit t: RType[T] parameter of getReg method and
    * checked against the actual value of the register.
    *
    * There are three cases:
    * 1) If the register doesn't exist.
    *   Then val x = SELF.R4[Int] succeeds and returns the None value, which conforms to
    *   any value of type Option[T] for any T. (In the example above T is equal to
    *   Int). Calling x.get fails when x is equal to None, but x.isDefined
   ...

##### GroupElement
```scala
/ Base class for points on elliptic curves. */
class GroupElement {
  / Exponentiate this GroupElement to the given number.
    * @param k The power.
    * @return this to the power of k.
    */
  def exp(k: BigInt): GroupElement
/* Group operation. /
  def multiply(that: GroupElement): GroupElement
/* Inverse element in the group. /
  def negate: GroupElement
/* Get an encoding of the point value.
    *
    * @return the point encoding
    /
  def getEncoded: Coll[Byte]
}
```

##### AvlTree
``scala
/** Type of data which efficiently authenticates potentially huge dataset having key-value dictionary interface.
  * Only root hash of dynamic AVL+ tree, tree height, key length, optional value length, and access flags are stored
  * in an instance of the datatype.
  *
  * Please note that standard hash function fromscorex.crypto.hashis used, and height is stored along with root hash of
  * the tree, thusdigest` size is always CryptoConstants.hashLength + 1 bytes.
  /
class AvlTree {
  / Returns digest of the state represented by this tree.
    * Authenticated tree digest = root hash bytes ++ tree height
    /
  def digest: Coll[Byte]
/* Flags of enabled operations packed in single byte.
    * isInsertAllowed == (enabledOperations & 0x01) != 0
    * isUpdateAllowed == (enabledOperations & 0x02) != 0
    * isRemoveAllowed == (enabledOperations & 0x04) != 0
    /
  def enabledOperations: Byte
/* All the elements under the tree have the same length of the keys /
  def keyLength: Int
/* If non-empty, all the values under the tree are of the same length. /
  def valueLengthOpt: Option[Int]
/* Checks if Insert operation is allowed for this tree instance. /
  def isInsertAllowed: Boolean
/* Checks if Update operation is allowed for this tree instance. /
  def isUpdateAllowed: Boolean
/* Checks if Remove operation is allowed for this tree instance. /
  def isRemoveAllowed: Boolean
/* Replace digest of this tree producing a new tree.
    * Since AvlTree is immutable, this tree instance remains unchanged.
    * @param newDigest   a new digest
    * @return a copy of this AvlTree instance where this.digest replaced by
    *         newDigest
/
  def updateDigest(newDigest: Coll[Byte]): AvlTree
/* Enable/disable operations of this tree producing a new tree.
    * Since AvlTree is immutable, this tree instance remains unchanged.
    * @param newOperations a new flags which specify available operations on a
    *                      new tree.

##### Option[T]
``scala
/** Represents optional values. Instances ofOption*  are either an instance ofSome(x)or the valueNone`.
 /
class Option[A] {
  / Returns true if the option is an instance of Some(value), false otherwise. 
   /
  def isDefined: Boolean;
/* Returns the option's value if the option is nonempty, otherwise
    * return the result of evaluating default.
    * NOTE: the default is evaluated even if the option contains the value
    * i.e. not lazily.

  def get: A
/* Returns a Some containing the result of applying $f to this option's
   * value if this option is nonempty.
   * Otherwise return None.
   *
   * @note This is similar to flatMap except here, $f does not need to wrap its result in an $option.
   *
   * @param  f   the function to apply
   * @since  2.0
   * @see flatMap
   /
  def mapB: Option[B]

#### Predefined global functions
ErgoScript standard library include predefined functions that can be called 
without prior declaration.
The following function declarations are automatically imported into any script:
```scala 
/* Returns true if all the elements in collection are true. /
def allOf(conditions: Coll[Boolean]): Boolean
/* Returns true if at least on element of the conditions is true /
def anyOf(conditions: Coll[Boolean]): Boolean
/* Similar to allOf, but performing logical XOR operation instead of && /
def xorOf(conditions: Coll[Boolean]): Boolean
/* Returns SigmaProp value which can be ZK proven to be true 
 * if at least k properties can be proven to be true. 
 /
def atLeast(k: Int, properties: Coll[SigmaProp]): SigmaProp
/* Embedding of Boolean values to SigmaProp values. As an example, this
 * operation allows boolean expressions to be used as arguments of
 * atLeast(..., sigmaProp(myCondition), ...) operation.
 /
def sigmaProp(condition: Boolean): SigmaProp
