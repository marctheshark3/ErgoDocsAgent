## Votings

The Ergo Foundation members and officers discuss proposals before putting them to a formal vote on the ergoforum, passed with a majority of voting members. Before voting on spending treasury funds, we will approach the [Good Whale Fund](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-11-02-good-whales-grant-fund/), [DarkFund0](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/darkfund0-zk-fund-for-privacy-applications/398), or suggest creating a [Raffle](https://ergoraffle.com/) if appropriate. Foundation votes this year are usually related to our internal structures, exchanges, market-makers, banks, and grant requests. ## 2024
