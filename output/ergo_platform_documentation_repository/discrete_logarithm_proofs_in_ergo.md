# Discrete Logarithm Proofs in Ergo

## Overview

Discrete logarithm proofs are a fundamental cryptographic primitive in Ergo's signature verification mechanism, based on the computational hardness of the discrete logarithm problem in elliptic curve cryptography. ## Key Characteristics

- **Cryptographic Foundation**: Proofs of knowledge of a discrete logarithm (DLog) verify signature authenticity without revealing the secret key
- **Schnorr Signature Basis**: Ergo uses Schnorr signatures built on discrete logarithm proofs

## Technical Details

- **Proof Structure**: Demonstrate knowledge of secret exponent `w` such that `g^w = x`
  - `g`: Generator of an elliptic curve group
  - `x`: Public key point
  - `w`: Private key

## Related Cryptographic Concepts

- [Sigma Protocols](sigma.md)
- [Threshold Signatures](threshold.md)
- [Ring Signatures](ring.md)

## Implementation in ErgoScript

In ErgoScript, discrete logarithm proofs are implemented using the `proveDlog()` predicate, which returns true if a valid proof of knowledge can be provided. ```scala
// DLog-based signature verification
val pubKey = ...  // Public key point
val signature = ...  //
