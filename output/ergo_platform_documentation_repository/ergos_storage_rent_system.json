This can be likened to an 'on-chain garbage collection' mechanism that not only mitigates the issue of blockchain bloat but also turns it into a profitable venture for miners.\nStorage rent is a minimal fee levied on unspent output (UTXOs) or 'boxes' after a period of four years of inactivity. The fee per byte is determined by the storage rent subprotocol. On average, this amounts to approximately 0.14 ERG every four years for a typical box.\nFor a more in-depth understanding of Ergo's storage rent system, please refer to this detailed guide.\n/// admonition | Guide\n    type: tip\nHow do I consolidate my wallet?\n///"
