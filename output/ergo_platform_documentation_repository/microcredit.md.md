A lot of blockchain-related news these days **is** telling us that a bank _X_ or a corporation _ Y_ is going to use a "blockchain" to "reduce costs". Basically, it means that just another buzzword is considered by large financial institutions as just another tool to extract value more efficiently and to save costs by cutting jobs. While I am avoiding saying anything about "Satoshi's vision" (nothing but speculation could be dug up after his exodus), a broad view I witnessed among online forum users in the early years is that a cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people running small businesses providing not much above making ends meet, rather than depersonalized big financial capital.
