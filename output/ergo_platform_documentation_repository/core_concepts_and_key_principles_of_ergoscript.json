      "content": "Ergo is a blockchain platform that operates on the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model and employs a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism.\nErgo introduces an extended-UTXO model that enables the execution of intricate financial contracts, akin to those supported by Ethereum's account-based model.\nErgoScript, being aligned with Ergo's UTXO model, incorporates numerous UTXO-specific constructs such as Box, INPUTS, and OUTPUTS. A comprehensive list of these constructs can be found in the LangSpec.\nA Box, essentially a UTXO, can accommodate up to ten registers for data storage. Analogous to Bitcoin, an Ergo transaction consumes one or more existing boxes (represented by the INPUTS array) and produces one or more new boxes (represented by the OUTPUTS array).\nErgoScript is not Turing complete, but it is possible to build Turing-complete applications, as demonstrated in this peer-reviewed paper."

      "heading": "ErgoScript Syntax",
      "content": "ErgoScript's syntax is a subset of Scala's. However, proficiency in Scala is not a prerequisite for learning ErgoScript. The Scala elements used in ErgoScript are minimal and straightforward, such as val. Unlike Java or Python, both Scala and ErgoScript access arrays using round parentheses. Hence, OUTPUTS(0) denotes the first element of the OUTPUTS array. In contrast to Scala, ErgoScript does not support the var keyword; all defined elements are immutable. ErgoScript, like Scala, supports functional programming, which simplifies interactions with collections using concepts such as foreach, exists, fold, etc.\nAn ErgoScript program, akin to ErgoTree, consists of a sequence of boolean predicates connected using && (AND) and || (OR).\nErgoScript provides cryptographic operations via BigInt and GroupElement (Elliptic curve point) types, along with associated operations like addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. It's important to note that BigInt operations in ErgoScript are performed modulo 2^256, unlike in Scala, hence overflow needs to be carefully managed."

      "heading": "Spending",
      "content": "An interacting party willing to spend the coin first constructs a prover with a set of secrets it knows, and then the prover is executed in two steps:\nReduction: The prover uses the ErgoTree interpreter, which deterministically reduces the ErgoTree proposition to a compound cryptographic statement (aka sigma proposition, \u03a3-protocol) by evaluating ErgoTree over the known shared context (state of the blockchain system and a spending transaction). This step produces a value of the SigmaBoolean type.\nSigning: The prover turns the obtained (and possibly complex) \u03a3-proposition into a signature with the help of a Fiat-Shamir transformation. This step produces a proof that the party knows the secrets, such that the knowledge can be verified before the spending transaction is added to the blockchain.\nTo allow valid coin spending, a verifier runs the ErgoTree interpreter with the following three inputs:\nA guarding proposition given by an ErgoTree\nThe blockchain context of the transaction being verified\nA proof (aka transaction signature) generated by a prover\nThe verifier is executed as part of transaction validation for each input and proceeds in three steps:"
    },
    {
      "heading": "Reduction",
      "content": "Same as the prover, the verifier uses the ErgoTree interpreter and deterministically produces a value of the SigmaBoolean type. However, this step must finish the evaluation for any possible inputs within a concrete fixed time limit (aka maximum cost), which the interpreter checks."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Cost estimation",
      "content": "The verifier estimates the complexity of the cryptographic Sigma proposition (based on the size and the concrete nodes of the SigmaBoolean tree). The spending fails if the estimated cost exceeds the maximum limit."

    {
      "heading": "Signature verification",
      "content": "The signature checker takes:\nThe proof\nThe SigmaBoolean (aka sigma protocol proposition)\nThe signed message (e.g., transaction bytes).\nThe checker then verifies the proof, which means it verifies that all the necessary secrets were known and used to construct the proof (i.e., sign the transaction)."
