Alternatively to the simple instructions below, see [Tutorial: Running an Ergo Full Node on a Headless Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/ccgarant/ergo-full-node-raspi) for a more comprehensive start to finish setup guide. ### Prerequisites \n\n- Pi4 with 4gb RAM or above is optimal. - Due to the intensive disk I/O, a SSD with 64GB+ is preferred. ### Preperation\n\n```\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install default-jdk -y\n```\n\nInstall the Java JDK\n\n```\nsudo apt install default-jdk\n```\n\n#### SWAP Size\n\nThe Raspberry Pi is a very powerful device but it has some limitations which prevent it from syncing a full Ergo node quickly and efficiently.",
