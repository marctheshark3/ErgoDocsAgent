      "content": "If the transaction is spending boxes protected by a non-trivial script, its inputs should also contain proof of spending correctness - context extension (user-defined key-value map) and data inputs (links to existing boxes in the state) that you may use during script reduction to crypto, signatures that satisfies the remaining cryptographic protection of the script. \nTransactions are not encrypted, meaning you can publicly view transactions included in blocks."
