It includes an execution bot/batcher for automating order matching without user interaction. Explore the project [here](https://github.com/Telefragged/off-the-grid/) and check out our [Getting Started Guide](off_the_grid_tut.md). ### Features\n\nOff the Grid provides the following features:\n\n- Utilizes a contract that permits spending only if orders are correctly filled or with the order owner's signature. This contract can manage multiple orders simultaneously.",

This contract can manage multiple orders simultaneously.\nEmploys off-chain bots/batchers to monitor grid orders and match them against other liquidity sources.\nCurrently, it matches orders against Spectrum Automated Market Makers (AMMs). However, it can be extended to other sources like the SigUSD bank.\nSupports trading of ERG against any token, with profits accumulated in ERGs.\nEnables grid orders to profit from repeated execution of the same orders, while bot operators benefit from arbitraging the price difference between the liquidity source and grid orders.\nThis concept was introduced by @kushti on ergoforum.\n\"We can do decentralized grid trading on Ergo (which is automatically compatible with existing DEXes, such as Spectrum LP pools and babel fees). Grid trading is a good way to make profits from volatility, and many CEXes offer it.\"\nCheck out the first decentralized grid order transaction on Ergo."
