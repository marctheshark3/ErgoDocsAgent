  "summary": "---\ntags:\n- Sharding\n- Sub Block Confirmation Protocols\n- Microblocks\n---\n# Layer 1: On-chain Scalability in Ergo\n\nLayer 1, the foundational protocol layer of a blockchain system, is responsible for core functions such as transaction processing, consensus mechanisms, and security protocols. Ergo's Layer 1 is designed with a focus on scalability, incorporating features that boost transaction processing capacity and overall throughput. ## Current Scalability Features\n\n### Extended UTXO Model (EUTXO)\nErgo utilizes an enhanced version of Bitcoin's UTXO model, known as EUTXO, which enables:\n\n- Turing Complete smart contracts\n- Parallel transaction processing\n- Higher throughput compared to account-based models\n- Efficient state management\n\n### Protocol Optimizations\nRecent developments have improved the protocol's efficiency through:\n\n- Removal of unused complexity from the Sigma protocol\n- Enhanced code readability and maintenance\n- Refined transaction ordering and mempool tracking\n- Regular node version updates addressing performance\n\n## Mainnet 5.0 and Beyond\n\n### Just-in-Time Costing\nThe introduction of [Just in time costing](jitc.md) in Node V5 has led to:\n\n- 5-10x increase in block capacity\n- Improved transaction processing capability\n- More efficient resource utilization\n\n### Miner Parameter Adjustments\nDevelopers are actively exploring:\n\n- Increased block size parameters\n- Enhanced transaction size limits\n- Optimized mining efficiency\n- Improved difficulty calculations through Autolykos updates\n\n## Future Scalability Enhancements\n\n### Microblocks and the Ergo Block Extension Section\n\nErgo's [block](block.md) structure includes extension sections containing:\n\n- Mandatory and arbitrary key-value data\n- Anchors for microblock creation\n- Support for service chains\n- Potential for generic sidechain implementation\n\nThese features enable:\n\n- Faster block generation times\n- Improved transaction throughput\n- Support for velvet or soft forks\n- Creation of Aspen-style service chains\n\n\n### Sub-Block Confirmation Protocols\n\nErgo is actively developing sub-block confirmation protocols that will:\n\n- Group transactions into sub-blocks\n- Reduce confirmation times\n- Increase overall throughput\n- Improve transaction processing efficiency This development is guided by EIP-15 and builds upon established research from platforms like:\n\n- [Bitcoin-NG](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-eyal.pdf)\n- [Flux](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc20-li-chenxing.pdf)\n\n\n\n\n### Sharding\nSharding represents a promising avenue for future scalability improvements by:\n\n- Partitioning the blockchain database into smaller segments\n- Enabling parallel transaction processing\n- Maintaining security while improving throughput\n\nFor detailed information, refer to:",
