    {
      "heading": "How It Works",
      "content": "Crystal Pool leverages Ergo's advanced smart contract capabilities and the eUTXO model to create a decentralized order book and matching engine directly on the blockchain. Users can submit limit orders, which are stored on-chain as unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). The Crystal Pool smart contracts then match compatible buy and sell orders, executing trades and transferring assets between the respective parties.\nBy operating on Layer 1, Crystal Pool eliminates the need for centralized order books or off-chain matching engines, ensuring transparency, security, and censorship resistance. Additionally, the self-custodial nature of the platform allows users to maintain full control over their assets at all times."

    {
      "heading": "Benefits",
      "content": "Real-Time Trading: Crystal Pool enables real-time order matching and execution, providing a seamless trading experience similar to centralized exchanges.\nSecurity and Self-Custody: Users retain full control over their assets, eliminating the need to trust a third-party custodian.\nTransparency and Censorship Resistance: All orders and trades are recorded on the immutable Ergo blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing censorship.\nComposability: As a Layer 1 solution, Crystal Pool can seamlessly integrate with other Ergo-based protocols and applications, enabling greater composability and innovation.\nCrystal Pool represents a significant step forward in decentralized exchange technology, combining the benefits of self-custody and transparency with the user experience and liquidity of centralized platforms."
