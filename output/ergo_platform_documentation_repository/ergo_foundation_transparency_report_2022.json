This focus is recognised and supported by the Ergo Foundation.\nThe Ergo Foundation is committed to organic and non-breaking development of the Ergo Platform protocol. The Foundation ensures that protocol changes are approved not only by miners - who express their will directly on the blockchain - but also by users and projects building on top of Ergo.\nThe Ergo Foundation is committed to maximising the number of valuable ecosystem developments accomplished in open-source with the least permissive licence possible.\nThe Foundation is also dedicated to helping with building trustless environments, smart contracts and payment frameworks for the public with privacy in mind. The Foundation believes that the Treasury should be distributed mainly to the community, including freelancers, hackers, experts and enthusiasts."

While the EF strives to lay the foundations and help ignite community marketing and, subsequently, compounding growth, beyond this, the marketing and promotion of Ergo rest principally on the shoulders of the community. (Get Involved!)\nThe EF does not commonly pay for influencers or ad campaigns and does its best to restrict frivolous spending, which is deemed not cost-effective  (i.e. airdrops, giveaways).\nThe marketing department highlights projects building in the ecosystem. However, these initiatives do not constitute an endorsement from the Ergo Foundation. The Foundation will always use best practices to vet projects and ensure that there is no risk for potential users. Still, in the early stages of development, it is often unknowable if anything of substance will ultimately be produced."

    {
      "heading": "Exchanges",
      "content": "One of the primary reasons the Ergo Foundation exists is to act as a legal entity to deal with centralised exchanges. Since genesis, Ergo has been listed on several exchanges, including three Tier 1 exchanges (KuCoin, gate.io, Huobi).\nA tier 1 exchange is defined as an exchange that appears in the top 10 of exchange ranking sites such as defillama.com/cexs\nExchange discussions and details are always under Non-Disclosure Agreement ('NDA'). To clear up some misconceptions, we can release the following details.\nListings are usually expensive. \nExchanges do not buy liquidity or any of the native tokens or coins on the open market generally. Instead, we use a third-party Market Maker ('MM'), which has access to an API with a preallocated amount of ERG and USDT it uses to create a liquid market. The MM can only buy/sell and lacks the credentials to withdraw assets. \nAll major exchanges have been approached, and the EF has not rejected any exchanges due to them being too expensive.\n\u2018But why is coin x listed?\u2019\nPossible reasons include the following:\nThey are a native asset on an already integrated chain (i.e., ERC20, Cosmos, etc.). Therefore, very little work is required to add and maintain a new chain here.\nFor Layer 1's:\nHave venture-capitalist funding and connections, which they can utilise to get listed early. \nHave a smaller public distribution than ERG and can bargain with exchanges for a percentage of their total supply. \nAre less complex than Ergo, with no native asset support, no need to worry about UTXO dust, etc. \nThey may be older than Ergo and were listed during the last bear. \nEven though they are a unique Layer-1, they may only have a wrapped asset (i.e., on BSC) listed.\nYou can follow along on our Weekly AMAs to catch any hints regarding the current exchange listing efforts."

      "heading": "Historic Spending",
      "content": "The Ergo Foundation has spent the majority of the Treasury for the benefit of the protocol and community. Funds were even spent when the ERG price was low, as it was necessary to bootstrap the thriving community Ergo now boasts.\nSalaries account for 70-90% of spending in most months, with the remainder in order of amounts usually being Bounties and Grants, Marketing expenses, and Administrative/General expenses. However, big one-off expenses, mainly exchange listings, lower this percentage substantially when looking at a longer time frame.\n| Spent | ERG | USD |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2022  | 723,000 | $2,247,640.00 |\n| 2021  | 889,001 | $3,793,485.00 |\n| 2020  | 1,080,000 | $500,292.50 |\n| 2019 | 757,051 | $590,239.31 |\n| Total | 3,449,052 | $7,131,656.80 |"

This is essential for both the strength of the ecosystem and ensuring that Ergo is not classified as a security.\nThe Sigmanauts Programme was launched at the start of 2022 to fill this need and build the required structures to pass the baton to the community.\nThe Ergo Foundation will likely exist for some time yet, and it may exist in some form for perpetuity as a legal entity to take counterparty risk when dealing with centralised actors.\nAlternatively, it could continue to exist as a research branch to encourage the development of applications and protocols which adhere to its original goals of supporting blockchain technology for social good, truly decentralised infrastructure and privacy as a basic human right.\nThe best course of action is to grind and build infrastructure for when liquidity leaks or flees existing systems. Focus on user security assumptions, privacy and longer-term non-fragility.\nNot something we can necessarily force, time or predict, but we can position ourselves."
