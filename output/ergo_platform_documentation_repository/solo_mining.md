If you decide to proceed with solo mining, you have two options:
Use a Mining Pool's Solo Port: Some mining pools offer a solo port for miners who prefer to work independently. You can find a list of such pools on Mining Pool Stats.


Host Your Own Pool: If you prefer to have complete control over your mining process, you can set up and host your own mining pool. Our pool setup guide provides detailed instructions on how to do this.
Remember, solo mining requires a good understanding of the mining process and a significant amount of resources. Make sure to thoroughly evaluate your options before you start.
