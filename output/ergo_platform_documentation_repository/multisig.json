This means that it requires more than one private key to sign and authorize a crypto transaction or, in some cases, that several different keys can be used to generate a signature.\u201d This type of wallet is valuable to an ecosystem because it adds a second layer of protection to the end user. A multisig wallet requires everyone with a private key to confirm the transaction for it to be authorized and executed. This provides an added layer of security for protection against hacks because an attacker would need all of the private keys to gain access to the wallet's funds.",
