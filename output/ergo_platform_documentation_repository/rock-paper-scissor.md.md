## Summary
Our next example of a multi-stage contract is the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, often used as an introductory example for smart contracts. The game is played between two players, Alice and Bob. Each player chooses a secret move independently, and the game outcome is decided after both secrets are revealed. Let `a`, `b` âˆˆ Z<sub>3</sub> be the secret choices of Alice and Bob, respectively, where (0, 1, 2) represent (rock, paper, scissors). If `a = b`, the game is a draw.
