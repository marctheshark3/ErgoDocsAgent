This is not possible with Bitcoin. While Ethereum can achieve this, it would be expensive and complicated \u2013 especially with a ring size of 10 or 20 members, which might be required for robust privacy. With Ergo, this kind of application can be created quickly, thanks to the integration of Sigma protocols in the core. This enables **self-sovereign application-level privacy**: trustless scripts that can be used to access mixers or other functionality without requiring any third parties.",
