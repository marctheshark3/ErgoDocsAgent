This feature allows you to achieve full node security on a standard laptop within minutes, eliminating the need to check approximately 95% of the blockchain. This addresses the increasing demands for downloading, storing, and processing the entire blockchain. This mode is akin to the *fast-sync* in Geth or Grothendieck and *warp-mode* in Parity, used by Ethereum protocol clients, but with more aggressive optimizations. ## Getting Started\n\n> Important: You cannot restore an old wallet with a pruned node.",

The recommended approach is to create a new wallet and transfer funds to it.\nAdd the following utxo and nipopow sections to your node configuration to enable UTXO Set Snapshots.\n```conf\nergo {\n    node {\n        mining = false\nutxo {\n       utxoBootstrap = true\n       storingUtxoSnapshots = 0\n    }\n    nipopow {\n       nipopowBootstrap = true\n       p2pNipopows = 2\n    }\n}\n}\nscorex {\n    restApi {\n        apiKeyHash = \"324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf\"\n    }\n}\n```\nNote on Progress Reporting: Currently, the node may not provide detailed progress updates specifically during the download phase of the UTXO snapshot itself when utxoBootstrap = true. Synchronization progress for headers and subsequent blocks is typically visible via the node panel (/panel) or logs, but the snapshot download phase might appear as a period of inactivity before regular block processing resumes."

This research paper indicates that this method can be as secure as processing all blocks under certain statistical assumptions.\nFor more information see the Technical Details."
