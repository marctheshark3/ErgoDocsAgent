      "heading": "Ergo Configuration Sections",
      "content": "The root configuration section ergo encompasses essential application parameters and various other configuration subsections. There is also another root section, scorex, which contains parameters inherited from the Scorex project.\nThe directory parameter allows you to define a path to the base application directory. You can use environment variables to override configuration parameters. For instance, the base directory path is constructed relative to the user's HOME environment variable by default. Refrain from enclosing references to environment variables in quotation marks, as they will be treated as literal strings and not resolved."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Network Settings",
      "content": "The scorex.network section allows you to configure settings related to the P2P network.\nUsing the declaredAddress parameter, you can establish the external IP address and port number that your node advertises to peers. This is necessary for operating behind NAT, common in cloud hosting scenarios where the machine doesn't directly interface with the external IP address. If left unspecified, your node will connect to the P2P network but won't accept incoming connections, meaning other nodes cannot connect to it. Other nodes use these settings to connect to your node. The format for this parameter is \"<ip-address>:<port>\".\nYou can use the bindAddress parameter to set the IP address of the local network interface where the Ergo Node will listen for incoming P2P connections. By default, the node binds to \"0.0.0.0\", indicating it will listen on all available network adapters.\nAbout Internet Address Settings\nInternet Address settings follow the \"<ip-address>:<port>\" format. Note that the :<port> component is crucial.\nFor the bindAddress setting, the port component establishes the network port number on which your node listens for incoming connections from other Ergo nodes. Please ensure this port is externally accessible (e.g., through firewall rules and port forwarding); otherwise, your node will only establish outgoing connections. If the specified port is already occupied by another application, your node will fail to start.\nYou can use the nodeName parameter to assign a visible name to your node for other participants in the P2P network. This name is transmitted during the initial handshake. In the default configuration, this parameter is commented out, resulting in a randomly generated node name.\nThe knownPeers parameter stores a list of bootstrap node addresses that your node will attempt to connect to upon initialization.\nAbout Time Settings\nAll time span parameters are specified in milliseconds by default. However, you can use duration units for convenience. Suppor..."

    {
      "heading": "REST API Settings",
      "content": "In the scorex.rest-api section, you can configure the node's REST API parameters.\nUse the bindAddress parameter to select the network interface and port where the REST API will accept incoming connections (e.g., \"127.0.0.1:9053\").\nWarning! For security reasons, avoid changing bindAddress from \"127.0.0.1\" (localhost) unless you fully understand the implications. Exposing the API directly to the internet is highly discouraged. For external access, use secure methods like Nginx's proxy_pass module with HTTPS or SSH port forwarding.\nUse the apiKeyHash parameter to set the Blake2b hash of your chosen API key (password). This key protects access to sensitive API endpoints (like wallet operations). Note that you provide the hash in the configuration, but you must provide the plain text API key itself in the api_key HTTP header when making REST calls. You can use tools like blake2b-cli or online calculators to generate the hash of your chosen API key.\nWarning! The API key is transmitted as plain text in the HTTP header and can be intercepted if the connection is not secured (e.g., using HTTPS or SSH tunneling). An attacker intercepting the key could potentially access wallet functions and transfer your funds! Always protect API access.\nThe corsAllowedOrigin parameter configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support for the REST API. Setting it to \"*\" allows requests from any origin, which is necessary for tools like the Swagger UI and web-based wallets interacting directly with the node API. You can restrict it to specific origins for enhanced security if needed. Read more about CORS here."

    {
      "heading": "API Performance, Timeouts, and Limits",
      "content": "Several configuration parameters can influence the performance and behavior of the node's REST API, especially under heavy load:\nRequest Timeout: The scorex.restApi.timeout setting (see Scorex Config) defines the maximum time the node will spend processing a single API request before timing out (default is often 5 seconds). If you experience timeouts during complex queries or high load, you might consider increasing this value, but be aware of the potential resource implications.\nConcurrency Handling: The processing of API requests is managed by Akka dispatchers. The api-dispatcher settings (see API Dispatcher Config) control the number of threads (parallelism-min, parallelism-factor, parallelism-max) and the processing throughput (throughput) for handling concurrent API requests. Tuning these values might improve responsiveness under load but requires understanding Akka dispatcher configuration.\nRate Limiting: The Ergo node software does not include built-in application-level rate limiting for its API endpoints. If you need to protect your node from excessive API requests, you should implement rate limiting externally, for example, using a reverse proxy server like Nginx or HAProxy placed in front of the node.\nJVM Memory: Overall node performance, including API responsiveness, can be affected by the allocated Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory. Ensure the node has sufficient heap space allocated via the -Xmx flag (e.g., -Xmx4G) when starting the node, as described in the Manual Installation Guide. Insufficient memory can lead to increased garbage collection pauses and slower response times, potentially contributing to timeouts under load."
