## Summary
I think that edge can play a big part in the development ecosystem if itâ€™s being utilized, maintained and improved over time. And ergo-play-boilerplate can give newcomers barebone code to jump into the world of ergo development and get their feet wet super quickly. Edge - https://github.com/Ergo-Lend/edge
