These artworks are represented as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Moreover, these NFTs can be traded in decentralized auction houses, providing artists with a global platform free from governmental restrictions or the need for centralized licensing firms. This leads to the democratization of art markets through public blockchain.\nThere are existing examples like Rarible and Opensea, which are auction markets operating on the Ethereum Network. While these platforms allow any artist to create and sell their artwork, the gas prices for minting an NFT can reach up to $100. Ergo's scalable and efficient design significantly reduces these gas costs without compromising on security or speed.\n//// note | Marketplaces\n/// details | ErgoAuctions\n     {type: success, open: true}\nErgoAuctions is a platform where you can bid on and sell a variety of collectible tokens, art, and more.\n///\n/// details | SkyHarbor\n     {type: success, open: true}\nSkyHarbor is a trusted marketplace that specializes in set price transactions. \n///\n/// details | Mew Finance\n     {type: success, open: true}\nMew Finance offers NFT marketplace capabilities through their platform:\nMew Mart: Specifically designed as a marketplace for trading various tokens and NFTs within the Ergo ecosystem.\nMew Store: Primarily focused on physical assets, but can also be an option depending on your NFT type.\nPlatform Benefits:\nHigher tiers (4-6) share in platform revenue, and Tier 6 members enjoy zero fees on DEX transactions.
