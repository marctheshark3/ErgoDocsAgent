      "heading": "Spending Proof for Expired Boxes",
      "content": "The term \"spending proof\" typically refers to a cryptographic authorization required for spending a box. However, in the context of an expired box, this requirement is waived. The spending proof for the expired box must be empty, meaning that no cryptographic validation is needed to authorize its spending. This allows any participant to spend the expired box without needing to prove ownership, as long as the storage fee duration condition is fulfilled."

      "content": "If both the above conditions are met, the expired box can be spent by anyone. To do so, one needs to provide an index of a newly recreated box (or an index of any box, if the expired box lacks sufficient funds for the storage fee) in the context extension variable #127, which will be stored as part of the input."

      "content": "Querying Storage Rent Endpoint\nExpired boxes should be validated against the dedicated storage rent endpoint before spending.\n\nThis ensures that the expired box has fulfilled the required storage rent conditions before it is spent.\n\n\nIntegration with Mining Pools\n\nMining pools using Miningcore can now query storage rent block candidates through MiningRequestSRBlockCandidateAsync() using this fork\n\nThis ensures that block templates correctly account for expired boxes under storage rent rules.\n\n\nImplementation in ErgoClient\n\nThe ErgoClient class has been updated to include a SrUrl field, allowing seamless communication with the storage rent service.\n\nThe MiningRequestSRBlockCandidateAsync() method fetches block templates that consider storage rent rules, ensuring compliance with Ergo\u2019s state management policies.\n\n\nSpending an Expired Box Affected by Storage Rent\n\nIf an expired box lacks sufficient ERG to pay the required storage rent fee, a new valid box must be referenced in the transaction.\nThis new box should either contain sufficient funds to cover storage rent or comply with mining pool policies for processing expired boxes.\nThe storage rent logic ensures that old, unused boxes do not persist indefinitely in the blockchain state."
