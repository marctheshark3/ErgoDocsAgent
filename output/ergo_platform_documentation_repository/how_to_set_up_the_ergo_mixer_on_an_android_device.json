  "summary": "# How to Set Up the Ergo Mixer on an Android Device\n\n## Getting Started\n\nRunning ErgoMixer on an Android device is important because it enables an individual who may not own a desktop or laptop computer to take advantage of the privacy features available in ErgoMixer. It will make it possible for someone with a mobile device to utilize Ergo's Sigma protocols to enable efficient, trustless mixing of funds, enabling a high degree of privacy and security. ## Device Requirements\n\nThere are some minimum system requirements to run ErgoMixer on Android. Android OS of version 7.0 or higher, a minimum of 10GB of available storage, and a minimum of 1GB ram available for apps. So far, this has been tested and is working well on a Samsung Galaxy S8+.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nA terminal emulator app is required to run an Ergo node on an Android device.",

You can find a keyboard called Hacker's Keyboard in F-Droid that worked great for me.\nInstalling a package called tmux will help if you want to run other programs alongside the Ergo Mixer within Termux. It is possible to run the Ergo node in one tmux pane and the mixer in another."
