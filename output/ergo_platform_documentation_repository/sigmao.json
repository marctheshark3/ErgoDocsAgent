      "heading": "What are Options?",
      "content": "Options are like contracts that give you the choice to buy or sell something (like stocks or cryptocurrencies) at a fixed price before a certain date. There are two main types:\nCall Options: These let you buy something at a set price in the future.\nPut Options: These let you sell something at a set price in the future.\nHow are Options Used?\nHedging: Imagine you own Ergo tokens and are worried their value might drop. You could buy a put option, which gives you the right to sell your Ergo tokens at a fixed price, protecting you from losses if the price falls.\nSpeculation: Let's say you believe the price of Ergo tokens will increase soon. You could buy a call option, allowing you to purchase Ergo tokens at a set price in the future. If the price goes up, you can buy them at the lower price stated in the option and then sell them at the higher market price, making a profit.\nGenerating Income: Alternatively, you could sell a call option if you don't think Ergo's price will rise significantly. You'll receive money upfront for selling the option, and if the price stays below the agreed price, you keep the money without having to sell any tokens.\nLearning More:\nBeginner's Options Course\nThe Options Playbook"

      "heading": "Understanding Sigma'O: Simplified Explanation",
      "content": "Sigma'O is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ergo blockchain. It was initially developed for the Ergohack VI event and is now available for testing at sigmao.cc.\nWhat Sigma'O Does:\nToken Creation: It allows users to create standard EIP-4 tokens, representing the value of an option on another Ergo EIP-4 token.\nTrading Platform: Sigma'O provides contracts for trading Ergo tokens and Sigma'O options in an order book style exchange.\nPermissionless Contracts: All contracts used by Sigma'O are permissionless, meaning developers and UIs interacting with Sigma'O contracts do not have any privileges. There's no updatable configuration by an \"app owner.\"\nOption Contracts:\nType: Sigma'O options can be either Call (grant to buy an underlying token) or Put (grant to sell an underlying token).\nStyle: They can be American (exercisable up to the maturity date) or European (exercisable during 24h after the maturity date).\nShare Size: Represents the number of tokens granted per option.\nStrike Price: The price of the underlying asset when exercising the option.\nMaturity Date: The end of the grant of the option.\nMinting Option Tokens:\nWhen Sigma'O options are created, a reserve is ensured to allow for the option's exercise.\nExercising Options:\nExercising an option burns the options used, as the associated reserve is consumed.\nThe exercise period depends on the type of option (American or European) and the exercise type (Call or Put).\nOrder Book Trading:\nSigma'O implements \"Open sale order\" and \"Open buy order\" contracts for trading options and tokens. \nThese contracts are refundable at any time to the issuer and ensure fair trading.\nPriced Sell Contracts:\nSigma'O also supports priced sell options for options on an underlying token with an Oracle price or Spectrum liquidity pool. \nThis allows for real-time pricing based on market conditions.\nExact Formula: The exact computation implemented in Ergoscript and JS can be found here and here.\nFuture Developments:\nThe SigmaO tea..."

      "content": "Gold Oracle Token Option:\n\nAn opportunity was presented for users to engage in European options for gold oracle tokens. These options allowed participants to speculate on the future price of gold oracle tokens by acquiring the option for a set ERG amount and exercising it before a specified date with a predetermined strike price. This mechanism enabled users to potentially capitalize on price movements within the given timeframe. View Option Details\n\n\n\nGORT Token Option:\n\nOptions were introduced for GORT tokens, providing users with the ability to speculate on its price dynamics. Participants could purchase a predetermined amount of GORT at the current price within a specified time frame by investing a set amount of ERG. If the price of GORT increased during this period, users could exercise the option, acquiring GORT at the initial price and potentially profiting from the price difference. Conversely, if the price remained stagnant or decreased, users could choose not to exercise the option, limiting their loss to the initial investment. This mechanism served as a tool for hedging against market volatility and exploring potential profit opportunities. View Option Details"
