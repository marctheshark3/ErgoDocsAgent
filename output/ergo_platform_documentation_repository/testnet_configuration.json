This helps reproduce real-world scenarios like having multiple GPU miners.\ninternalMinerPollingInterval is the polling interval for GPU miners.\nmaxTransactionCost sets the maximum cost for a transaction to be propagated across the network.\nadProofsSuffixLength determines the size of the suffix for dumping ADProofs during bootstrapping.\ncheckpoint is a mandatory checkpoint introduced due to some violations in the PaiNet."

A value of 1 means difficulty is recalculated every block.\nblockInterval is the desired time interval between blocks.\nmonetary.minerRewardDelay sets the delay between when a block is mined and when the reward can be spent.\nvoting contains parameters related to the voting mechanism, such as the length of a voting epoch, the number of epochs for soft-fork voting, and activation epochs for a soft-fork after acceptance.\nreemission includes parameters related to the emission process. \ngenesisStateDigestHex is the Base16 representation of the genesis state roothash."
