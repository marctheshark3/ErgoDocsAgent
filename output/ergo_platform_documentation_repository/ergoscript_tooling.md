### Introduction
ErgoScript is a domain-specific language designed specifically for the Ergo blockchain. It is inspired by Scala and allows developers to create secure and efficient smart contracts. While ErgoScript is not Turing-complete, it can be used to build Turing-complete applications by leveraging the extended UTXO model of the Ergo blockchain.
The ErgoScript ecosystem offers a wide range of tools and resources to help developers at all levels, from beginners to experienced professionals. These tools include playgrounds, tutorials, courses, explanations, references, and examples.
