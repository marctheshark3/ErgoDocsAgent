It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. Docker Compose is particularly useful for development, testing, and staging environments, as well as CI workflows.\nThe recommended method for installing Docker Compose is to install Docker Desktop, which includes Docker Compose, Docker Engine, and Docker CLI. These are all necessary components for running multi-container Docker applications.\nYou can download Docker Desktop for your specific Operating System from the following link: Docker Desktop"
