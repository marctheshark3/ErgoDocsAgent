# dApp Connector


[Fleet](fleet.md) lets you easily create Ergo transactions with a pure JS library. There is also [NightOwl dApp Connector](https://github.com/nightowlcasino/dApp-connector-react-package) React package and accompanying [video tutorial](https://twitter.com/NightOwlCasino/status/1529452399475179520). <!--Specifically with Nautilus, to avoid conflicts, you can call `ergoConnector.nautilus.connect()` in place of `window.ergo_request_read_access()` and `ergoConnector.nautilus.isConnected()` in place of `window.ergo_check_read_access()`-->
