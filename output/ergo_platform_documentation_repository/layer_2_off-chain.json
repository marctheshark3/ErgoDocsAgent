Their purpose is to enhance the efficiency, scalability, and capabilities of the underlying blockchain by facilitating *off-chain* transactions or computations. Ergo is compatible with a broad range of Layer 2 solutions derived from other UTXO blockchains. The platform can implement various off-chain solutions like [Hydra](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/hydrafast-isomorphic-state-channels/) and sidechains, which help alleviate blockchain congestion and offer benefits akin to ZK-rollups. > Join the Layer 2 discussion on [Telegram](https://t.me/ErgoLayer2) or [Discord]().",
