Think of it as a specialized language that allows you to create complex [financial contracts](contracts.md) and applications with unprecedented flexibility and [security](security.md). ## Key Characteristics\n\n### 1. UTXO-Based Model\nUnlike [account-based blockchains](accountveutxo.md), ErgoScript uses the [UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model](eutxo.md). This means:\n\n- Contracts define conditions for spending coins\n- [Transactions](transactions.md) are immutable and more secure\n- Improved",
