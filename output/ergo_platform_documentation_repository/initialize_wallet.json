Remember to use the plain text secret phrase, not the hash stored in the configuration file. In our example, this is the string hello.\nClick on Initialize wallet (or execute the /wallet/init or /wallet/restore endpoint). A pop-up or response will appear depending on the method used. You have two main options:\nInitialize a new wallet: If this is your first time running the node, choose this option to generate a new mnemonic sentence.\nRestore an existing wallet: If you have an existing wallet (e.g., from a previous installation or another wallet software) and want to access its funds, choose this option and provide your previously saved mnemonic sentence.\nChoose the option that suits your situation."

      "content": "In the pop-up form (or API request body for /wallet/init), enter a secure password for encrypting your wallet file. The 'Mnemonic password' (BIP-39 passphrase) field is optional but adds extra security. After clicking 'Send' (or executing the request), the API response will contain the generated mnemonic sentence.\nMake sure to copy this sentence accurately and store it securely offline. You will need this exact sentence (and the optional passphrase, if used) to restore your wallet later or on a different device."

      "content": "To restore an existing wallet, paste your previously saved mnemonic sentence into the 'Mnemonic' field in the Restore-wallet form (or the mnemonic field in the /wallet/restore API request). Enter a secure password to encrypt the restored wallet file. Leave the 'Mnemonic password' field empty unless your original mnemonic was created with a BIP-39 passphrase; in that case, enter the passphrase here.\nAfter successfully restoring the wallet from the mnemonic sentence, you will see a confirmation message."
