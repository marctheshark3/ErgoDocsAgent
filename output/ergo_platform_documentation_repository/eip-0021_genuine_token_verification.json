The EIP is meant to be updated regularly when new tokens of value are added. ## Motivation \n\nErgo tokens can hold a certain value, best-known examples are the SigUSD and SigRSV tokens in use by the SigmaUSD stablecoin protocol. Tokens can be minted by every user, with a name and description free to choose. This means everyone can mint new tokens named \"SigUSD\", which bears a problem for end-users to decide if a token they received is genuine or not.\n\n## Ergo tokens background\n\n[See EIP-4](eip4.md): Ergo supports custom tokens as first-class citizens.",

A transaction can create out-of-thin-air tokens in its outputs if the token \nidentifier is equal to the identifier of the first input box of the transaction.\nAs the box identifier is cryptographically unique, there's no chance to have the second token with the same identifier while the hash function being used \nis collision-resistant.\nIn order to verify the authenticity of a token, the unique identifier of a token is needed to check."
