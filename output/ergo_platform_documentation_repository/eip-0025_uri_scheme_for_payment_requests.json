Instead, it contains \nthe data that the wallet application should use to fill its payment form. The user can change the details when needed. The wallet will build the transaction, \nso this scheme is easier to handle on static websites or in e-mails."

Any ambiguity should be detected and if it cannot be resolved, the wallet should give a descriptive message to the user (not just \"Invalid URI\", but what exactly has been detected as invalid).\nAt the same time the wallet should not do anything implicitly, even if it is smart enough to so some implicit actions, it should display what is going on to the user on the transaction sending screen. The user should be aware that some implicit action where taken by wallet and that those actions will take effect when the Send button is pressed.\nApplying the above principles to the missing ERGs amount parameter problem we can see that it can be automatically resolved by the wallet, so the wallet shouldn't reject the URI as invalid when the amount of ERGs is missing. At the same time, the screen should have an explanation that non-zero amount of ERGs in the field is required and that it was suggested by the wallet.\nFor the case of duplicate tokens, the wallet CAN consider such URI as invalid, and clearly communicate the problem to the user so that the user can take a screenshot and send it back to the dApp developer. The duplication problem should be clear from the screenshot."
