By building upon Ergo's robust DeFi ecosystem and introducing sidechains, we aim to expand the decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply, creating a more inclusive and accessible financial system for the Ergo community and beyond.\nCompleted Milestones\nThe Ergo platform, with the support of the Ergo Foundation and community developers, has already made significant strides in developing its infrastructure and DeFi ecosystem. This includes launching basic infrastructure such as wallets and explorers, as well as a wide range of DeFi tools and trustless derivatives, such as:\n[x] SigmaUSD stablecoin (Djed protocol)\n[x] Spectrum DEX (AMM-based)\n[x] ErgoMixer (non-interactive, non-custodial mixer)\n[x] ErgoAuctionHouse (peer-to-peer auctions)\n[x] SigmaFi (peer-to-peer loans via bonds)\n[x] Duckpools (lending pools)\n[x] ErgoRaffle (decentralized crowdfunding)\n[x] EXLE (uncollateralized lending)\n[x] SigmaO (trustless options)\n[x] HodlCoin (trustless ERG derivative with non-declining price)\n[x] AuctionCoin (emission via auctions)\n[x] Oracle Pools (federated transparent data providing)\n[x] Rosen Bridge (two-layered federated bridge)\nThese tools collectively contribute to the creation of more trustless collateral through various means such as AuctionCoin, OptionCoin, and fair initial mining offerings. As a result, Ergo's decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply continue to grow. It's worth noting that the entire DeFi ecosystem on Ergo is built upon its unique ErgoTree/ErgoScript contractual layer, also known as Sigma, which provides a secure and flexible foundation for the development..."
