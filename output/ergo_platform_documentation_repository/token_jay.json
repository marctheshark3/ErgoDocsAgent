      "heading": "P2P Escrow",
      "content": "The open P2P Escrow service is a smart contract that facilitates trustless, private sales on the Ergo blockchain for a nominal fee. The contract accepts Ergo tokens, such as a non-fungible token (NFT), 100 SigUSD, or other token(s) from the seller. Once the tokens are in the contract, only a defined buyer sending a defined amount of ERG can access them. If the exchange is successful, the contract sends the tokens to the buyer and the ERG to the seller. The seller can cancel the contract at any time before the exchange is made."

      "heading": "How to use P2P Escrow:",
      "content": "Visit TokenJay\nConnect your wallet by scanning the QR code\nNavigate to 'Your Token Sales'\nClick 'Start New Sale'\nSelect the vesting key from your wallet\nEnter the buyer's address\nSet the price the buyer should pay (in $ per SPF token, converted into Erg)\nClick 'Sell Token'\nSign the transaction\nOnce the transaction is confirmed, the buyer can make the purchase via TokenJay. The offer will appear under 'P2P Escrow offers'. The buyer should verify the token and minting transaction to ensure its authenticity. If it's an Ergopad vesting key, they can verify the tokenid in the verifier API:\nhttps://api.ergopad.io/vesting/vestedWithKey/tokenid\nThis will return whether it is a real key, the token type, and the number of tokens. If everything checks out, they can click 'Buy' and sign the transaction.\nOnce the transaction is processed, the Erg is sent to the seller, the key is sent to the buyer, and the contract takes a small fee.\nFor more information, visit https://tokenjay.app/escrow.html"
