  "summary": "# Leveraging Context Variables in ErgoScript\n\nErgoScript provides the capability to create intricate programs with predicates that are context-dependent. Let's take a look at an example:\n\n```scala\nHEIGHT < 4000000            // address 2fp75qcgMrTNR2vuLhiJYQt\n```\n\nThis script uses the context variable `HEIGHT`, which signifies the height of the block in which the transaction is mined. If the blockchain height is less than 4,000,000, the box associated with this address becomes [\"anyone-can-spend\"](anyone-can-spend.md). Conversely, if the blockchain height equals or exceeds 4,000,000, the box becomes [\"no-one-can-spend\"](no-one-can-spend.md). Apart from `HEIGHT`, ErgoScript supports other context variables such as `OUTPUTS`, `INPUTS`, and `minerPubKey`.",
