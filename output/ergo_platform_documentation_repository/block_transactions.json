      "content": "Value Transfer: Ergo transactions enable users to transfer ERG (Ergo's native token) and other custom tokens/assets to other users on the network.\nState Transition: Each transaction consumes existing unspent boxes (which hold tokens and assets) and creates new boxes with potentially modified values and ownership. This process updates the state of the UTXO set.\nSmart Contract Execution: Transactions can trigger the execution of scripts within boxes, allowing for complex logic and decentralized applications to be implemented on the Ergo blockchain."

      "content": "The core structure of an Ergo transaction is defined by the ErgoTransaction class in ErgoTransaction.scala.\nHere's a breakdown of its main components:\ninputs: A list of Input objects, each referencing an existing box that the transaction will spend. Each input includes a spendingProof (see Transaction Signing) to prove the spender has the right to consume the box.\ndataInputs: A list of DataInput objects referencing boxes that the transaction needs to access for its scripts but won't spend. These provide data to the scripts without requiring ownership.\noutputCandidates: A list of ErgoBoxCandidate objects representing the new boxes that the transaction will create. These candidates define the values, assets, and scripts of the new boxes."

      "heading": "Validation",
      "content": "Ergo transactions undergo rigorous validation to ensure they are legitimate and maintain the integrity of the blockchain:\nStateless Validation: Checks that don't require accessing the blockchain state, including:\nEnsuring the transaction has inputs and outputs.\nVerifying basic rules (no negative values, unique inputs, etc.).\n\n\nStateful Validation: Requires accessing the blockchain state to check:\nWhether the inputs refer to valid and unspent boxes.\nWhether the spending proofs are correct.\nWhether the transaction adheres to rules related to assets, fees, and block size limits.\nWhether the scripts in the inputs are satisfied (using the ErgoInterpreter - see ErgoTree Evaluation)."

      "heading": "Key Concepts",
      "content": "Boxes: The fundamental building blocks of Ergo's UTXO model. They are containers that hold ERG, other tokens, and scripts (smart contracts).\nScripts: Programs written in ErgoScript (a powerful scripting language) that define the conditions for spending boxes.\nSpending Proofs: Cryptographic proofs that demonstrate the spender has the right to use the funds in a box, often involving signatures or more complex cryptographic protocols.\nContext Extension: A key-value map attached to a spending proof, providing additional data that can be used by scripts during validation.
