      "content": "You can create SigmaProp values from standard boolean expressions using the sigmaProp function. This allows you to define arbitrary spending conditions based on context variables, register values, etc.\n```scala\n{\n  val mathIsHard: Boolean = (1 + 1) != 2\n  sigmaProp(mathIsHard) // SigmaProp created from a boolean using the sigmaProp function\n                        // What would this contract evaluate to?\n}\n```"

      "heading": "SigmaProps From Public Keys",
      "content": "Public Keys (represented as GroupElement in ErgoScript, essentially the part of your address that makes it unique) can be directly converted into SigmaProp values using functions like proveDlog. When such a SigmaProp is used, the contract checks if the transaction was signed by the corresponding private key. You can think of this as literally signing the transaction with your digital signature to prove authorization.\n```scala\n{\n  // You can use the PK function to\n  // hardcode an address's public key into your contract\n  val myPK: SigmaProp = PK(\"9etXmP7D3ZkWssDopWcWkCPpjn22RVuEyXoFSbVPWAvvzDbcDXE\")\nmyPK\n}\n```"

    {
      "heading": "SigmaProp Operations",
      "content": "Much like booleans, you can use logical operations (&& for AND, || for OR) on SigmaProp values to build more complex spending logic for your contract.\n```scala\n{\n  val enoughERG = INPUTS(0).value > 1000000\n  val myPK = PK(\"9etXmP7D3ZkWssDopWcWkCPpjn22RVuEyXoFSbVPWAvvzDbcDXE\")\nsigmaProp(enoughERG) || myPK // What does this contract do? Under what conditions could such a contract be spent?\n}\n```\nYou can see in the contract above that using || creates two distinct spending paths (conditions under which the box can be spent).\nNow that you've seen the basics, let's look at a simple ErgoScript contract example: the pin-lock contract mentioned earlier."

    {
      "heading": "Pin-lock Contract",
      "content": "```scala\n{\n  sigmaProp( INPUTS(0).R4[Coll[Byte]].get == blake2b256(OUTPUTS(0).R4[Coll[Byte]].get) )\n}\n```\nDon't worry if you don't understand all the functions used here (blake2b256, .get); these are global functions covered elsewhere. What's happening here is:\nWe can spend INPUTS(0) (the first input box of the transaction) if and only if there exists an output box (specifically OUTPUTS(0), the first output) whose register R4 contains the Blake2b256 hash of the byte collection found in register R4 of INPUTS(0).\nThis contract implicitly assumes the box being spent is INPUTS(0). For a clearer example where the box explicitly refers to itself within its own contract, consider the version below using the SELF context variable:"

    {
      "heading": "Pin-lock Contract (with SELF)",
      "content": "```scala\n{\n  sigmaProp( SELF.R4[Coll[Byte]].get == blake2b256(OUTPUTS(0).R4[Coll[Byte]].get) )\n}\n```\nAre these two pin-lock contracts equivalent? That is, under what spending conditions might one contract evaluate to true while the other evaluates to false? (Hint: Consider what INPUTS(0) refers to versus what SELF refers to).\n\ud83d\udd17 From Deco Education - ErgoScript Developer Course"
