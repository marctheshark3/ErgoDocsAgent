  "summary": "# Light Full-Node Mode\n\nThe light full-node mode in Ergo allows for a more resource-efficient way of running a node while still maintaining full-node security. In this mode, the node only holds the root digest of the dictionary and checks full blocks or a suffix of the blockchain, depending on the setting. It uses AD-transformations to get a new digest from an old one and checks all transactions, but only stores a single digest. ## Features and Limitations\n\nThe light full-node mode supports wallet functionalities and custom scans, making it suitable for various use cases. However, it has a limitation: it can only accept and broadcast transactions initiated within its own network, not those coming from external peers.",

      "heading": "Getting Started",
      "content": "To run the node in light mode, you need to adjust specific settings in your ergo.conf file.\nCore Settings:\nergo.node.stateType = \"digest\": This is the key setting that enables light-fullnode mode. Instead of storing the full UTXO set, the node only maintains the authenticated root hash of the state and validates state transitions using ADProofs contained in the blocks. See stateType for details.\nergo.node.blocksToKeep = 1440 (Example): This setting controls how many of the most recent blocks are stored with full transaction data. Older blocks will only have their headers stored. Setting it to -1 keeps all blocks (similar to an archive node but still in digest state). A common value is 1440 (roughly one day). See blocksToKeep for details.\nBootstrapping Options:\nBootstrapping is the initial synchronization process. Light nodes have options to speed this up and reduce initial storage requirements:\nergo.node.nipopow.nipopowBootstrap = true: Instructs the node to download a NiPoPoW proof during startup. This significantly reduces the data needed for initial sync compared to downloading all headers from genesis.\nergo.node.utxoBootstrap = true: (Alternative to NiPoPoW bootstrap) Instructs the node to download a UTXO set snapshot to initialize its state. This can be faster but might require more initial bandwidth. Note: These two bootstrap options might be mutually exclusive depending on the node version; check current node documentation or configuration comments.\nExample Configuration:\n```conf\nergo {\n  node {\n    stateType = \"digest\"\n    blocksToKeep = 1440 // Keep ~1 day of full blocks\n    mining = false      // Usually false for light nodes\n# Choose one bootstrapping method (check compatibility):\nnipopow.nipopowBootstrap = true \n# utxoBootstrap = true\n\n# Optional: Adjust NiPoPoW parameters if using nipopowBootstrap\nnipopow.p2pNipopows = 2\n}\n}\nscorex {\n  restApi {\n    # Set your API key hash for security\n    apiKeyHash = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HASH_HERE\" \n  }\n  # Optional: Adjust ..."

      "heading": "Resource Considerations",
      "content": "Memory (RAM): While lighter than archive mode, digest nodes still require sufficient RAM, especially during bootstrapping. Users have reported needing to increase the JVM heap space using the -Xmx flag (e.g., java -Xmx1G -jar ... or higher) particularly when bootstrapping on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. Monitor your node's memory usage.\nDisk Space: Significantly lower than archive mode. With nipopowBootstrap and a reasonable blocksToKeep value (like 1440), the storage footprint after sync can be relatively small (potentially under 1GB, but this can vary). Using utxoBootstrap might require more temporary space during the snapshot download.\nCPU: Validation still requires CPU power, but generally less than an archive node maintaining the full UTXO set database."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Wallet Compatibility",
      "content": "General Support: Light-fullnodes running in digest mode can support wallet functionalities, including managing keys and creating transactions.\nPotential Issues: Some wallet implementations or specific wallet features might have compatibility issues with digest mode. This is because the node doesn't have the full UTXO set readily available locally, and certain queries might rely on that. Developers have reported issues in community channels, particularly concerning wallets needing to scan the full UTXO set or perform complex balance calculations.\nRecommendation: If you intend to use a specific wallet with a digest-mode node, verify its compatibility with the wallet developers or community resources. Standard transaction sending/receiving is generally expected to work."
