Make temporary contract edits (e.g., set a condition to always evaluate to `true`). 2.",

      "heading": "Is the EIP-3 Secret similar to an account index for derived public keys?",
      "content": "Yes, the EIP-3 secret functions similarly to an account index for deriving public keys. As confirmed by user 'Aberg (Satergo dev)', the Satergo wallet refers to this as the \"address index,\" and custom indices can be utilized."

      "heading": "How do I convert a Coll[Byte] of proposition bytes to the SigmaProp type?",
      "content": "The decodePoint method is likely what you need to convert proposition bytes (Coll[Byte]) into a SigmaProp."

      "heading": "Can I insert two tokens with the same ID but different amounts into a box?",
      "content": "Yes, you can, but be aware that some off-chain code might become confused. The amounts will be merged into a single entry in the box's tokens array."
    },
    {
      "heading": "How do I fix the \"Tree root should be real but was UnprovenSchnorr(ProveDlog(Ecp(...\" error?",
      "content": "This error usually indicates that the transaction was signed using an incorrect private key (i.e., one that doesn't correspond to the public key expected by the script)."

      "heading": "As a complete coding beginner, should I learn Java then Scala before ErgoScript?",
      "content": "It's generally recommended to focus on understanding UTXO model concepts first, rather than diving deep into Java or Scala initially. The courses available at https://docs.ergoplatform.com/dev/get-started/ provide a good starting point without requiring prior Java or Scala knowledge."

      "heading": "How are dApp fees handled in ErgoScript contracts?",
      "content": "In ErgoScript, fees are handled explicitly during the transaction building process, not directly within the script logic itself. The script verifies conditions based on the transaction outputs. See the Token Sale Service contract example for illustration: \nhttps://github.com/ergoplatform/ergoscript-by-example/blob/main/tokenSalesService.md\nKey aspects:\nThe transaction fee (MinTxFee) must be included in one of the output boxes (typically the last one, designated for the miner).\nOther output boxes handle the distribution of payment and token amounts according to the contract's logic.\nThe fee is paid from the value contained within the input boxes being spent."

      "heading": "How can Option/Some(...) be used in ErgoScript outside of registers and context variables?",
      "content": "The use of Option types (like Some(...)) is effectively limited to values originating from registers (box.R<N>[Type]) and context variables (getVar[T](...)). A potential workaround for other scenarios involves using a \"dummy\" optional register value and applying a map operation: box.R4[Boolean].map(r => <some expression which doesn't depend on r>)."

      "heading": "What's the proper syntax for fold/map/reduce operations in ErgoScript?",

      "heading": "Noted Issues",
      "content": "A bug existed in sigma-rust where coll.slice did not gracefully handle empty collections, differing from the Scala version used in nodes. This caused issues for approximately 3 weeks until fixed by user 'greenhat'. The fix has been merged into the develop branch of sigma-rust.\nThis fix needs to propagate through the dependency tree (including updates to libraries like ergo-lib-wasm and wallets like Nautilus) before fully resolving issues for all end users.\nSome unexpected exceptions have been reported when using .toBigInt on Long register values in ErgoScript. Further investigation is needed.\nWith ErgoNames, if a token representing a registered name is burned, that name registration is permanently lost. Potential solutions are being researched."
