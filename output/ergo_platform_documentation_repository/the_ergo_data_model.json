Like a UTXO, a Box is created when value is sent in a transaction and is consumed (spent) when that value is transferred elsewhere. However, Boxes add the following capabilities that go beyond basic UTXOs:\nImmutable State: Each box represents an atomic, immutable state unit that cannot be modified after creation. (Lifecycle details might be added later or linked if a dedicated page exists).\n\n\nTyped Registers: Boxes contain 10 registers (R0-R9) with specific purposes and rich computational potential:\n\nR0: Monetary Value (in nanoERGs)\nR1: Protection Script (Smart Contract)\nR2: Assets/Tokens\nR3: Creation Details\nR4-R9: Flexible, Typed Custom Data Storage\nSupports multiple data types: Int, Long, BigInt, GroupElement, Coll[Byte]\nCan store complex structures and collections\nDensely packed with type-safe access\n\n\n\n\n\nProgrammable Spending Conditions: Each box specifies precise conditions under which it can be spent, enabling complex logic through ErgoScript. See Box Modeling and Box Overview for detailed exploration.\nBy transforming UTXOs from simple value trackers to programmable state containers, Ergo enables more expressive and flexible blockchain interactions while maintaining cryptographic integrity and computational efficiency."
