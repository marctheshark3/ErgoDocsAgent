For suggestions to improve this guide, please reach out to us at team@ergoplatform.org or join our [`#development` channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/kj7s7nb). ## Key Features\n\n- Ergo's transactions consist of multiple *inputs* and *outputs*, similar to Bitcoin. Unspent outputs, known as **single-use entities**, are used once. Although built from the ground up, Ergo's scripts and transaction formats differ from Bitcoin's.",

Although built from the ground up, Ergo's scripts and transaction formats differ from Bitcoin's. For an in-depth understanding, refer to the Ergo 'Box' model.\nErgo incorporates standard scripts, associated with P2PK addresses, much like Bitcoin. Explore more about the address scheme here.\nAn Ergo UTXO box utilizes registers to store arbitrary values, such as native tokens, rather than a single amount (like BTC). Each box holds an ERG amount and may include {tokenid, token amount} pairs, adhering to the UTXO model.\nErgo's built-in wallet API caters to most use cases. The API employs a Swagger interface and operates on 127.0.0.1:9053 by default in the mainnet (9052 on the testnet).\nThe precision of each transaction on the Ergo platform is up to $10^{-9}$ ERG. This means that transactions can be made with a precision of up to 0.000000001 ERG.\nThe average interval time of each block on the Ergo blockchain is approximately 2 minutes."

For backup options, feel free to reach out to us at team@ergoplatform.org or join our group chat. You can also find a dynamic list of public nodes at api.tokenjay.app/peers/list.\nIf you choose to run a public node, you can access the web interface at 127.0.0.1:9053/panel. Please note that the port switches to 9052 on the testnet. For guidance on getting started with the testnet, please refer to this page.\nRunning an Ergo node requires a certain amount of disk space, which depends on factors like the size of the blockchain and the number of transactions. We recommend having at least 100 GB of disk space to ensure seamless operation.\nFor a more efficient setup, you can bootstrap a pruned node using a verified UTXO set snapshot and NiPoPoWs."

      "heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "Can P2S and P2SH be two address formats for the same script?\nYes. For P2S, the script is serialized directly into the address. For P2SH, the address contains only a hash of the serialized script.\nAre there issues with supporting address types other than P2PK?\nSupporting other types isn't a problem if the user is aware of what they're doing, but this is often not the case and can introduce complexity. P2S addresses can't validate input size in forms.\nHow are ergoTree and address related for conversions?\nIn appkit, Address.create() accepts an address string and returns an object from which you can obtain the ergoTree.\nTransaction Fees\nErgo's transaction fee system is designed to be flexible and explicit. Although the protocol does not enforce a specific minimum transaction fee, it employs a spam-prevention strategy that requires each box to contain a minimum amount of ERG based on its size. This minimum value is determined by a parameter voted on by miners.\nAs a guideline, it is suggested to allocate 0.001 ERG (1,000,000 NanoErg) for each box involved in the transaction. Including a fee incentivizes miners to process your transaction more quickly.\nMiners prioritize transactions based on either the fee per byte or the validation cost unit, which are adjustable via a voting mechanism among miners. Transaction fees are collected in a specific contract that can only be spent through a miner's script.\nTo determine the appropriate transaction fee, consider the protocol's minimum requirements based on the box size and the network's current hashrate. Higher hashrates reduce the risk of double-spend attacks, thus requiring fewer confirmations.\nFor more detailed information on transaction fees, including minimum values, miner prioritization, fee collection, and related topics, please refer to the dedicated Transaction Fees page.\nWhat algorithm generates a boxid?\nThe boxid is generated by hashing the box contents.\nSee the code in AppKit for details\nA box's bytes are unique becau..."

      "heading": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "content": "What is the difference between the value field and assets array in a box?\nEach box always has an ERG value in the value field. Assets are optional and are represented in the assets array. A box can contain a combination of ERG and tokens.\nWhat is the difference between inclusionHeight and creationHeight?\nCreation height is when the transaction was built, but it's not reliable since the person building the transaction can input a number <= current block height. Inclusion height is the block number where the transaction was first included (first confirmation).\nHow can I get the block number of the first transaction confirmation?\nCall /blocks/{blockId}/header to get the block height. The height in the header defines the block number in which the transactions from that block received their first confirmation.\nIs the numConfirmations value returned by /blockchain/transaction/byId/{txId} the number of transaction confirmations?\nYes, it is.\nWhat is considered a safe number of confirmations?\nA common practice is to use 10 confirmations for deposits, which takes about 20 minutes. Ergo doesn't have many forking events due to the relatively long block time.\nWhat's the difference between /wallet/balances and /wallet/balances/withUnconfirmed endpoints?\n/balances returns the balance excluding current unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. /balances/withUnconfirmed accounts for transactions in the mempool, returning the confirmed balance plus (or minus) unconfirmed transactions.\nWhich endpoint should be used to get the balance before sending a transaction?\nWhen working with chained transactions, it's better to use /balances/withUnconfirmed to get the balance before sending a transaction, as it reflects the \"new wallet balance\" after sending the previous transaction."
