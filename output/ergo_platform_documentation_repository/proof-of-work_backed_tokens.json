When a box is generated, the id of the future token is known. This id is computed through hashing.

This could include ids starting with a certain number of zeroes. Therefore, some computational work may be required to generate such a token, similar to the VanityGen-address concept in Bitcoin, but applied to tokens.\nCertain contracts may only accept these Proof-of-Work backed Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).\nWhile specific use-cases have not been fully explored, potential applications could include spam filtering.\nFor more detailed discussions, refer to this link."
