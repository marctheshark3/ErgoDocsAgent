It lays the foundation for a new wave of blockchain-based applications, focusing on scalability, security, and privacy. Ergo leverages advanced technologies like the powerful scripting language ErgoScript, flexible Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and the eUTXO model, an evolution of Bitcoin's UTXO model.\nGet a concise overview of Ergo, its standout features, and the technology and decisions that power it on the Why Ergo? page.\nFind answers to the most common questions about Ergo in our FAQ."

ErgoScript supports the creation of flexible crypto-contracts based on \u03a3-protocols (a class of Zero-Knowledge Proofs), allowing for privacy-preserving transactions and complex smart contract functionality.\n\n\nExtended UTXO Model (eUTXO): The eUTXO model allows each UTXO to carry arbitrary data and be protected by an arbitrary predicate or spending condition. This flexibility enables the representation of various assets, tokens, and smart contract states within the blockchain.\n\n\nMining with Autolykos: Ergo utilizes Autolykos, an efficient, ASIC-resistant Proof-of-Work algorithm designed for a fair launch.\n\nLearn about Ergo's Emission schedule.\n\n\n\nNiPoPoWs: Short for Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work, these are compact data structures that validate blockchain events without needing full network connectivity or downloading all block headers. They enable efficient light clients, log-space mining, and trustless sidechains.\n\n\nStorage Rent: Also known as demurrage, this mechanism mitigates blockchain bloat and turns it into a profitable venture by charging for on-chain storage.\n\n\nTuring-Complete Smart Contracts: Ergo supports Turing-complete smart contracts, enabling complex on-chain computations.\n::cards::\n[\n  {\n    \"title\": \"\ud83d\udcda DeCo EU Layman Class - Basics of eUTxO\",\n    \"content\": \"A great introductory course aimed at the layman from Decentralised Collaboration.\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAWeW6wajEw\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"\ud83e\uddfe Learning Ergo 101: eUTXO Explained for Human Beings\",\n    \"url\": \"https://dav009.medium.com/learning-ergo-101-blockchain-paradigm-eutxo-c90b0274cf5e\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"title\": \"\ud83d\udcf9 Learning Blockchains like Cardano and Ergo\",\n    \"content\": \"Discusses the process of learning blockchain concepts, emphasizing the importance of understanding theoretical aspects and practical interaction through playgrounds and nodes.\",\n    \"url\": \"https://w..."

      "heading": "Transactional Model",
      "content": "Ergo adopts a transactional approach similar to Bitcoin's UTXO model. In this model, transactions utilize and produce single-use entities known as 'boxes'. Every transaction in Ergo represents an atomic state transition, consuming boxes from the state and creating new ones in their place. The eUTXO model allows each UTXO to carry arbitrary data and be protected by an arbitrary predicate (or spending condition). The data can represent various tokens or smart contract states.\nThis image illustrates the structure and process flow of a blockchain transaction on the Ergo platform using its extended UTXO model (eUTXO)."

It is flexible enough to allow for ring signatures, multi-signatures, multiple currencies, atomic swaps, self-replicating scripts, and long-term computation.\nThe Account model of Ethereum is imperative, meaning that sending coins from Alice to Bob requires changing balances in storage through a series of operations. In contrast, Ergo's UTXO-based programming model is declarative. ErgoScript contracts specify conditions for a transaction to be accepted by the blockchain, not changes to be made in the storage state as a result of the contract execution."

Their advantage is that they are composable using simple AND/OR logic. When combined with a blockchain, these composable proofs enable very powerful use cases, allowing for the implementation of sophisticated tasks that would otherwise be impossible, risky, or expensive on other platforms."
