Introduced by the NiPoPoW paper, the key idea is that you can use the scheme even if only some blocks in the chain include the interlink structure and allows for \"gradual deployment\" without harming the miners that haven't upgraded to the new rules. In this way, it acts similar to a soft fork in that clients that upgrade to new rules are still compatible with those that don't.\nSoft-fork: Requires some nodes to upgrade. The recent re-emission Soft-Fork EIP37 was possible as it's enforced on miner nodes only via protocol rules. These can be approved with 90% support from miners.\nHard-Fork: Requires all nodes to upgrade."

      "heading": "Fork Activation Process",
      "content": "When a new feature or change is proposed, it goes through the following process:\nProposal and Discussion: The proposed change is discussed and evaluated by the Ergo community and developers.\nConsensus and Approval: If the proposal gains consensus and is approved, it is scheduled for implementation.\nFork Type Determination: Based on the nature of the change, it is determined whether a velvet-fork, soft-fork, or hard-fork is required.\nActivation: If a supermajority (90%+) of the network accepts the new feature, it is activated. Old nodes that do not upgrade continue to operate normally and skip over the new feature validation.\nBy following this process and leveraging the various fork types, Ergo aims to maintain a stable and secure network while enabling continuous improvement and innovation."
