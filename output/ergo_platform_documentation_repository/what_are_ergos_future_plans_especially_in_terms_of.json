      "content": "Ergo is a UTXO-based blockchain, whereas smart contracts are traditionally associated with account-based systems like Ethereum. However, Ergo's transaction model has many advantages over the account-based model. With the right approach, developing Ergo contracts can be significantly easier than writing and debugging Solidity code.\nThere's very few PoW+Smart-Contract blockchains that we're competing with, but it seems like the natural choice for Bitcoiners who want to utilise smart-contracts. Right now most of the projects trying to sidechain with bitcoin are EVM based or have a distribution which doen't align with Bitcoins values.\nDouble merged-mined sidechains offer an innovative approach to bridging Ergo with other PoW blockchains, such as Bitcoin, while minimizing trust requirements. In this setup, a Sigma Chain acts as a Bitcoin sidechain, including commitments to both the Bitcoin and the sidechain UTXO sets written on the blockchain. This enables the execution of rich applications directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, with Bitcoin transactions submitted to the Bitcoin blockchain and auxiliary data submitted on the sidechain.\nhttps://docs.ergoplatform.com/uses/sidechains/sigma-chains/#sidechain-constructions"
