      "content": "The services require access to an Ergo node, so if you do not have one yet install as instructed here: Ergo github\nBesides the node the services depend on tools such as Kafka and Redis to run, to make it easier to manage a docker based solution has been made to allow for easy building and running of the services.\nThe only requirements besides the node are that you have the following installed:\n - GIT to download the code and help fetch updates. GIT\n - SBT (which requires Java) for building the bots. SBT\n - Docker and Docker-compose (included in Docker for Windows). Docker"

      "heading": "Building",
      "content": "First, you need to download the code from this repo. The easiest way to keep it updated in the future is by using git:\nbash\ncd <the folder you want to keep the off-chain services code in>\ngit clone https://github.com/ergolabs/ergo-dex-backend.git\nInstructions for building the services are all combined in the build script and the docker-compose.yml file. The only configuration needed for running the services need to be stored in a file called config.env. An example can be found in config-example.env\nMake a copy of the example file, name it config.env and edit the file to match your values:\nbash\ncd ergo-dex-backend\ncp ./config-example.env ./config.env\nThe 2 values that need to be changed in the config.env file are the address you want to recieve fees on and the URI to your node (localhost/127.0.0.1 might not be accessible from within a docker container, it is best to use the local lan ip if the node is running on the same host).\nFinally the Docker images need to be build before running them:\nbash\n./build"
