  "summary": "# FAQs: Rosen Bridge Operations and Features\n\n### What is the bridge fee structure? Initially, it's the greater of $10 or 0.5% of the transaction value, plus network fees, adjustable by the guard set. The fee is collected in the transferred token on Ergo. Network fees vary: static for Ergo and Cardano, dynamic for EVM-based networks. ### Is there a maximum amount for a single transaction on Rosen Bridge?",

      "heading": "Is there a maximum amount for a single transaction on Rosen Bridge?",
      "content": "No fixed maximum, but large transfers may take longer, from hours to 1-2 days, due to manual guard intervention for fund transfers from cold to hot wallets."

      "heading": "How is ADA managed within the system for transactions to Cardano?",
      "content": "Network fees in the transaction token on Ergo are sent to a dedicated address for covering network fees on different chains. Currently, the Rosen team manually manages this, with plans for future automation."

      "heading": "How can a project add new token options to the bridge?",
      "content": "Projects pay a listing fee to the Rosen Fund, with potential discounts for open-source projects. This involves minting wrapped tokens and updating the token map. Fees are distributed to watchers and guards."

      "heading": "What are the next chains to be added following ADA?",
      "content": "The roadmap includes BTC, BSC (EVM-chains), and Dogecoin in the midterm. Code refactoring aims to facilitate adding new chains, with initial chains being the most challenging."
