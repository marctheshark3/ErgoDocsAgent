# Ergo Puppet

[Ergo Puppet](https://github.com/dav009/ergo-puppet) is an advanced tool, building upon the foundational capabilities of the [Ergo Playground](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds). It is designed to facilitate experimentation with and unit testing of Ergo contracts in an offchain setting. One of the key features of Ergo Puppet is that it heavily utilizes AppKit. This implies that the majority of your code should be compatible with Puppet without necessitating any modifications. Ergo Puppet thus serves as an efficient and seamless way to test your Ergo contracts, further simplifying the development process.
