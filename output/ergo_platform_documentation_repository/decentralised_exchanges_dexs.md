## Summary
# Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs)

Until 2020 DeFi Summer, Value Locked in DeFi ([TVL](https://medium.com/coinmonks/google-sheets-analytics-total-value-locked-in-defi-33b926c18a9f)) was too low to use the platforms effectively. After an increasing interest and new token issuance every day, Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) came into the sunlight. Their benefits are for people who don’t want to give up the custody of their funds. DEXes democratized the exchange experience for both blockchain developers and crypto investors. //// note | Decentralised Exchanges on Ergo
