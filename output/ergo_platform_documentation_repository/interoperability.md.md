## Summary
*Most users won’t care about the underlying blockchain they’re using – they will just want its functionality. That means DeFi interoperability will be critical. * Despite the open-source nature of the blockchain world, crypto projects have always tended to have an ‘us-and-them’ mentality. The assumption is that for one platform to succeed, it must be at the expense of all the others.
