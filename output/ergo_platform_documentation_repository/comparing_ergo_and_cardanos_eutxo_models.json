Alex's expertise, gained from working on projects like NXT and smart-contract.com, before his 'ScoreX' project caught the attention of IOG (Input Output Global), the company behind Cardano and he was hired as Research Fellow and Team Scorex Manager.\nHowever, driven by a shared vision to innovate, Alex and Dmitry decided to pursue an independent path, leaving IOG to create Ergo. They aimed to combine the strengths of the extended UTXO (eUTXO) model with the robustness of Proof-of-Work (PoW).\nCentral to Ergo's ethos is a fair launch, ensuring a balanced token distribution and preventing wealth concentration. This commitment to fairness has resonated within the Ergo community.\nLeveraging their technical expertise, Alex and Dmitry have positioned Ergo at the forefront of innovation by integrating eUTXO with PoW as well as several other novel innovations. This unique framework enables the development of secure, scalable, and efficient decentralized applications."

      "heading": "Programming Languages and Data Storage",
      "content": "Ergo employs a language known as ErgoScript, which draws inspiration from Scala. Conversely, Cardano uses a language named Plutus, which is inspired by Haskell. Ergo stores data in registers, while Cardano uses \"datum\" for data storage. Despite these differences, both platforms allocate a space within the UTXO to maintain the state of decentralised applications (dApps). Cardano employs a two-layer architecture, utilizing Plutus for smart contracts and Marlowe for financial contracts.\nErgoScript, the scripting language of Ergo, facilitates the development of complex smart contracts and advanced features. Cardano's Plutus language is also robust and powerful, but in some cases, certain complex functionalities may necessitate the incorporation of supplementary components or alternative approaches to implementation.\nHere's a comparison of ErgoScript and Plutus (Cardano's smart contract language):\n| Feature                         | ErgoScript (Ergo)                                   | Plutus (Cardano)                  |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Language design                 | Based on Scorex framework, influenced by Scala      | Based on Haskell                  |\n| Strongly typed                  | Yes                                                 | Yes                               |\n| First-class functions           | Yes                                                 | Yes                               |\n| Higher-order functions          | Yes                                                 | Yes                               |\n| Rich data structures            | Registers, boxes                                    | Datum, UTXO                       |\n| Zero-knowledge proofs           | Supported                                           | Planned for future development    |\n| Complex authentication schemes  | Supported                                         ..."

      "heading": "Native Tokens on Cardano",
      "content": "Native tokens on Cardano allow for the transacting of multiple assets, including ada and custom tokens, without the need for smart contracts. This feature extends the accounting infrastructure to accommodate various assets. Native tokens are different from non-native tokens that require smart contracts.\nAssets on Cardano are uniquely identified by an asset ID, consisting of a policy ID and asset name. Tokens with the same asset ID are fungible. Ada is the principal currency for fees and rewards, while native tokens can be used for payments and transactions.\nCardano's minting policy uniquely identifies each native asset with a permanent policy ID, which originates from the policy script. The policy script further defines other attributes, such as the asset's name and amount/value. Since asset names are not unique, Cardano NFTs must be identified by the policy ID, which can be publicly available to distinguish fraudulent/duplicate NFTs from the original tokens.\nA minimum ada value is required to transfer native tokens between addresses. Token bundles organize tokens and are the standard way to represent assets on Cardano.\nMinting policies specify the rules for creating and burning tokens, and each asset has a permanent association with a minting policy. The native token lifecycle involves minting, issuing, using, redeeming, and burning tokens, with various actors involved, such as asset controllers, token issuers, and token holders. Tokens can also be reissued by token holders acting as reissuers for trading or liquidity purposes."

      "heading": "Global State Management",
      "content": "The management of global state in Ergo and Cardano is influenced by their respective scripting languages and transaction validation processes. Ergo utilizes ErgoScript, a call-by-value, higher-order functional language without recursion. ErgoScript defines a guarding proposition for a coin as a logical formula that combines predicates over a context and cryptographic statements provable via \u03a3-protocols with AND, OR, k-out-of-n connectives.\nAlthough ErgoScript is not inherently Turing complete, Turing completeness can be achieved in Ergo using transaction trees, as outlined in this peer reviewed paper. A transaction tree is a structure where transactions are organized into a tree, with each transaction referencing its parent transaction(s). This allows for complex, multi-step computations to be executed across multiple transactions, effectively making Ergo Turing complete.\nThis organization of transactions enables developers to create more complex and flexible smart contracts on Ergo, similar to those written in Cardano's Plutus language. However, this method requires more manual construction of transaction structures and may not be as intuitive as using a Turing-complete language like Plutus.\nErgo's transaction validation uses the ErgoLikeStateContext trait and ErgoLikeStateContext case class to represent the blockchain context. The sigmaLastHeaders method provides information about the previous blocks, while the previousStateDigest method provides the UTXO set digest from the last header. The sigmaPreHeader method provides information about the current block being validated.\nIn contrast, Cardano uses Plutus, a Turing-complete, higher-order functional programming language subset of Haskell, designed specifically for smart contracts. While ErgoScript focuses on the transactional model and guarding propositions for coins, Plutus provides a more general-purpose language for writing smart contracts.\nFor more information, refer to these foundational papers:\nImproving aut..."

      "heading": "Privacy Features",
      "content": "Ergo's cryptographic design incorporates Sigma protocols, providing extensive access to discrete log-based zero-knowledge proofs, offering potential advantages in privacy and security. Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic techniques that enable a prover to demonstrate the truth of a statement to a verifier without revealing any additional information. In the context of blockchain technology, zero-knowledge proofs can enhance privacy and security by allowing transactions and smart contracts to be executed without disclosing sensitive data.\nDiscrete log-based zero-knowledge proofs refer to a class of zero-knowledge proofs that rely on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem, a foundational concept in modern cryptography. ErgoScript, the scripting language used in Ergo, provides access to \u03a3-protocols, a subclass of cryptographic proof systems known as non-interactive \u03a3-protocols. These \u03a3-protocols include the Schnorr signature scheme and Diffie-Hellman tuple, which can be used to prove knowledge of discrete logarithms. This efficient and flexible implementation of zero-knowledge proofs can improve privacy-enhancing features and applications on Ergo.\nErgo's Sigma Protocols enable the implementation of sophisticated tasks that would otherwise be impossible, risky, or expensive, allowing for self-sovereign application-level privacy. Trustless scripts can access mixers or other functionality without any third parties required. Using Ergo for such applications, users can achieve enhanced privacy and security compared to other platforms."

      "heading": "Data Inputs",
      "content": "Spending UTXOs is at the core of the extended UTXO smart contract model, and all execution happens when a UTXO is spent. However, having to spend every single UTXO which you wish to read data from has several drawbacks:\nThe smart contract of the UTXO with the data must execute, thereby increasing computation complexity/cost.\nThe UTXO must be spent, meaning only one transaction can use the UTXO data per block/slot.\nTransaction fees increase due to needless excess execution & recreation of the output data UTXO.\nEvery UTXO which wishes to allow read access through spending must encode the logic directly within their smart contract.\nIt is liable to spam attacks by bad actors who wish to wreak havoc on a protocol.\nIncreased off-chain complexity in transaction creation & finding the latest UTXO.\nTo address these issues, the core Ergo developers, Alexander Slesarenko, Alex Chepurnoy, and Dmitry Meshkov, introduced the concept of \"read-only inputs\". These allow any transaction to reference any other box(UTXO) currently in the UTXO set and read the data without any problems listed in the previous section."

This feature enables Ergo to access off-chain data and use oracles, facilitating various applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), prediction markets, and data-driven smart contracts. Data inputs can also help minimize transaction fees, as only the necessary boxes are consumed in the transaction process."

Cardano's implementation of data inputs is just one example of how we can work together.\nOne notable development between the Ergo and Cardano communities is Rosen Bridge, which is currently live. This bridge enables the transfer of wrapped ADA tokens from Cardano to Ergo and vice versa, promoting interoperability and collaboration between the platforms and their communities. Cardano users can now access the DeFi ecosystem on Ergo with this bridge using wrapped ADA or native ADA tokens.\nMoreover, ErgoMixer, as the only token mixer in the space, enables users to mix wrapped ADA and other native tokens, such as wrapped HOSKY. After mixing the tokens in ErgoMixer, users can bridge them back to Cardano. These native tokens can be used in SigmaFi, SigmaO, or any budding dApps available on sigmaverse.io."

While ErgoScript and Plutus, their respective scripting languages, have different foundations and design principles, they both enable the creation of sophisticated smart contracts and blockchain applications.\nErgo's approach to minting policies allows for more complex NFTs and token attributes, while Cardano's policy provides a simpler method for token issuance. Both platforms have implemented solutions to access off-chain data and oracles through data inputs, broadening their potential applications and use cases. Furthermore, their collaboration through the eUTXO Alliance and developments like Rosen and Reference Inputs demonstrate the potential for cross-platform cooperation and growth in the blockchain ecosystem.\nBoth Ergo and Cardano offer unique strengths and capabilities, making them appealing choices for developers, users, and investors alike. As these platforms continue to evolve and collaborate, they will undoubtedly contribute significantly to the advancement of blockchain technology and the adoption of the eUTXO model."
