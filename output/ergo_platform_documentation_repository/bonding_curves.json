There is a cheap way to do bonding curves on Ergo, with most of the load performed off-chain. Assume a project is willing to issue 100 tokens and sell the first one for `100` ergs, second for `200`, ..., 100th for `10,000` ergs (to raise 505,000) in total in case of full sale. This is a very simple example of a bonding curve. See [this article](https://blog.relevant.community/bonding-curves-in-depth-intuition-parametrization-d3905a681e0a) for more details.",

      "content": "First, assume a token sale scenario only. The token issuer creates 100 boxes with one token each, with a set price for the token in register R4 of a box. The box is spendable if the spending transaction pays the price to the issuer's address (issuer's script in general)."

The selling contract requires a spending transaction to lock 95% of the price, at least with buying contract. Buying contract is time-locked and requires a spending transaction to send token bought-back to a predefined address (e.g. issuer's)."
