# Ring Signatures in Ergo

## Overview

Ring signatures are an advanced privacy-preserving cryptographic technique that allows a user to sign a transaction on behalf of a group without revealing which specific group member signed it. ## Key Features

- **Anonymity**: Provides plausible deniability by obscuring the actual signer
- **Privacy**: Prevents tracing the origin of a signature to a specific participant
- **Flexible Composition**: Implemented through Ergo's Sigma protocols

## Use Cases

1. **Anonymous Transactions**: Enabling privacy in blockchain transactions
2. * *Decentralized Mixers**:

## Content
### Overview
Ring signatures are an advanced privacy-preserving cryptographic technique that allows a user to sign a transaction on behalf of a group without revealing which specific group member signed it.

### Key Features
Anonymity: Provides plausible deniability by obscuring the actual signer
Privacy: Prevents tracing the origin of a signature to a specific participant
Flexible Composition: Implemented through Ergo's Sigma protocols

### Use Cases
Anonymous Transactions: Enabling privacy in blockchain transactions

Decentralized Mixers: 

ErgoMixer Privacy Protocol
ZeroJoin Privacy Mechanism



Confidential Voting: Where the voter's identity must remain secret

### Technical Implementation
In Ergo, ring signatures are implemented using Sigma protocols, allowing for:
Proving knowledge of one secret from a set of secrets
Creating cryptographic proofs that obfuscate the true signer

#### Example Scenario
scala
// Simplified conceptual representation
val ringSignature = prove {
  atLeastOneOf(
    List(
      proveDlog(pubKey1),
      proveDlog(pubKey2),
      proveDlog(pubKey3)
    )
  )
}
