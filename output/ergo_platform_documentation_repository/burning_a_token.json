      "content": "The burn token functionality integrated by ThierryM1212 can be observed here. The crucial steps involved are as follows:\nIdentify and select the input boxes holding the tokens to be burnt, along with a small ERG amount.\nConstruct the output boxes, excluding consideration of the tokens. The transaction builder automatically appends an additional output change box encompassing all tokens.\nRetrieve the transaction JSON representation.\nEdit the output change box details to eliminate the tokens intended for burning.\nDispatch the modified transaction (JSON) to the network.\nThis streamlined approach simplifies the process of burning tokens while maintaining transaction integrity."
