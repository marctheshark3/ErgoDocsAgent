# Sigma JS

> **Sigma JS is currently under development and not yet ready for production use. **

## Introduction
Sigma JS, in conjunction with [Fleet](fleet.md), aims to offer a user experience for Javascript developers that is comparable to what [AppKit](appkit.md) provides for JVM developers. ## Resources

Here are some resources to help you understand and follow the development of Sigma JS:

- [JS module on npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sigmastate-js)
    - This module is the result of the Scala.js compiler working on [this branch](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/pull/833)
    - [sigmajs-crypto-facade](https://github.com/anon-br/sigmajs-crypto-facade) is a project that aims to replace BouncyCastle's elliptic curve dependencies in the Sigma.
