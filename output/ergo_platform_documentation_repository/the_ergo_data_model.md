# The Ergo Data Model

This document provides a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of Ergo's unique data model, based on the [UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)](eutxo.md) model, enhanced with powerful [smart contract](ergoscript.md) capabilities ([eUTXO](eutxo.md)).

## 1. Theoretical Foundations & Core Concepts

### 1.1 Computational Model Evolution & UTXO vs. Account Model

Ergo represents a significant advancement in blockchain computational models, extending the traditional Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) paradigm through its enhanced [eUTXO (Extended UTXO)](eutxo.md) model. Unlike conventional blockchain architectures, Ergo's model introduces:

* **Programmable State Transitions**: Enabling complex computational logic within [transaction outputs](box.md). This contrasts with the account-based model used in other blockchains (like Ethereum), where state is globally mutable.

## The Ergo Data Model
This document provides a comprehensive and in-depth exploration of Ergo's unique data model, based on the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model, enhanced with powerful smart contract capabilities (eUTXO).

#### 1.1 Computational Model Evolution & UTXO vs. Account Model
Ergo represents a significant advancement in blockchain computational models, extending the traditional Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) paradigm through its enhanced eUTXO (Extended UTXO) model. Unlike conventional blockchain architectures, Ergo's model introduces:
Programmable State Transitions: Enabling complex computational logic within transaction outputs. This contrasts with the account-based model used in other blockchains (like Ethereum), where state is globally mutable. See UTXO vs Account Model Comparison for a comparison of Ergo's model in terms of parallelism, privacy, and scalability.
Stateless Verification: Allowing efficient validation without maintaining complete blockchain state, facilitated by technologies like NIPoPoWs.
Deterministic Execution: Ensuring predictable and verifiable transaction outcomes.

Extension Section: An exploration of Ergo’s flexible data storage section that can hold additional metadata and information beyond basic transactions.

### 3. Boxes: Foundational State Units
At the core of Ergo's data model is the "Box," which is Ergo's implementation and extension of the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) concept. While traditional UTXOs simply track unspent coins, Ergo's Boxes enhance this model with additional programmable capabilities.

#### 3.1 The Box Concept
A Box is essentially a "smart UTXO" - it serves the same role as a UTXO in tracking unspent value, but extends this with sophisticated computational features. Like a UTXO, a Box is created when value is sent in a transaction and is consumed (spent) when that value is transferred elsewhere. However, Boxes add the following capabilities that go beyond basic UTXOs:
Immutable State: Each box represents an atomic, immutable state unit that cannot be modified after creation. (Lifecycle details might be added later or linked if a dedicated page exists).


Typed Registers: Boxes contain 10 registers (R0-R9) with specific purposes and rich computational potential:

R0: Monetary Value (in nanoERGs)
R1: Protection Script (Smart Contract)
R2: Assets/Tokens
R3: Creation Details
R4-R9: Flexible, Typed Custom Data Storage
Supports multiple data types: Int, Long, BigInt, GroupElement, Coll[Byte]
Can store complex structures and collections
Densely packed with type-safe access





Programmable Spending Conditions: Each box specifies precise conditions under which it can be spent, enabling complex logic through ErgoScript. See Box Modeling and Box Overview for detailed exploration.
By transforming UTXOs from simple value trackers to programmable state containers, Ergo enables more expressive and flexible blockchain interactions while maintaining cryptographic integrity and computational efficiency.
