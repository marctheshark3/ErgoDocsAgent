  "summary": "---\ntags:\n  - Token Integration\n  - Cross-Chain\n  - Rosen Bridge\n  - Guide\n  - Tutorial\n  - Ethereum\n  - Cardano\n  - DeFi\n  - DEX\n  - Analytics\n  - Security\n---\n\n# Cross-Chain Token Integration Guide for Rosen Bridge Tokens\n\nThis guide outlines the process for integrating and listing tokens that have been bridged between networks using Rosen Bridge. Whether you're bridging from Ergo to Cardano, Cardano to Ethereum, or any other supported network combination, these steps will help ensure your token is properly integrated across ecosystems. ## Overview of Cross-Chain Possibilities\n\nTokens can be bridged between any networks connected via Rosen Bridge. This means:\n\n- Ergo tokens can be bridged to Cardano/Ethereum\n- Cardano tokens can be bridged to Ergo/Ethereum\n- Future networks will be supported as they're added to Rosen Bridge (BSC, DOGE)\n\n### Key Considerations for Multi-Chain Presence\n- Each bridged version represents the same token on different networks\n- Liquidity needs to be managed across all chains\n- Analytics and trading platforms should be integrated per network\n- Community education needed for cross-chain functionality\n\n## Phase 1: Initial Listing and Market Data Setup\n\n### Market Data Platforms Overview\n\n#### CoinGecko\nThe world's largest independent crypto data aggregator. Generally easier to get listed compared to CoinMarketCap but still requires significant volume and legitimate activity.\n\n- Submit via [CoinGecko Token Request Form](https://www.coingecko.com/request-form/tokens/new?locale=en)\n- Follow the [CoinGecko Verification Guide](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/23725417857817-Verification-Guide-for-Listing-Update-Requests-on-CoinGecko)\n\nOptions:\n\n- For tokens with existing listings + decent volume: Potential automatic acceptance\n- Alternative: $400 for fast-track listing\n\n#### CoinMarketCap\nThe most recognized crypto data platform globally.",
