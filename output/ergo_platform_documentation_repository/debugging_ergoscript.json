      "content": "Given the limitations of on-chain debugging, a strong emphasis must be placed on off-chain testing and careful design:\nThorough Unit & Integration Testing: This is the most crucial aspect. Use testing frameworks provided by SDKs like Appkit (Scala), Fleet SDK (JS/TS), or Sigma-Rust to simulate transaction scenarios off-chain.\n\nCover expected behavior (happy paths).\nTest edge cases and potential failure conditions.\nVerify expected outputs, register values, and created boxes.\nTest logic under various simulated context states.\nUse property-based testing where applicable.\n\n\n\nCareful Logic Design:\n\nPrioritize simplicity.\nBreak down complex logic.\nReason carefully about execution paths and state transitions.\nConsider economic exploits.\n\n\n\nCode Reviews: Have peers review your contract logic.\n\n\nFormal Verification (Advanced): Consider for highly critical contracts (tooling is evolving)."

      "heading": "Debugging Techniques Overview",
      "content": "Explore the following pages for details on specific techniques:\nScala-Based Debugging: Leverage Scala's debugging tools by testing your contract logic within the JVM environment (e.g., using Appkit or sigmastate-interpreter tests). This is often the most effective way to step through logic off-chain.\nOn-Chain Mechanisms (Limited): Understand the limited tools available for insights during on-chain execution, such as the experimental debug() function and analyzing transaction failure logs.\nExternal Tools & Simulators: Utilize off-chain simulators (like the Spectrum Finance simulator) and other tools (SDK playgrounds, online editors) to test and analyze script behavior in controlled environments."

      "content": "The community desires more advanced debugging tools, potentially including execution traces and enhanced simulators. As the ecosystem evolves, improved tools may emerge.\nRigorous off-chain testing remains the cornerstone of developing reliable ErgoScript contracts."
