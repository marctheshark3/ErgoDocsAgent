    {
      "heading": "Paradigm",
      "content": "The account model of Ethereum is imperative. This means that the typical task of sending coins from Alice to Bob requires changing the balances in storage as a series of operations. Ergo's UTXO-based programming model, on the other hand, is declarative. ErgoScript contracts specify conditions for a transaction to be accepted by the blockchain (not changes to be made in the storage state due to the contract execution)."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Scalability",
      "content": "In the account model of Ethereum, both storage changes and validity checks are performed on-chain during code execution. In contrast, Ergo transactions are created off-chain, and only validation checks are performed on-chain, thus reducing the number of operations performed by every node on the network. In addition, due to the immutability of the transaction graph, various optimization strategies can improve the throughput of transactions per second in the network. Light verifying nodes are also possible, thus further facilitating scalability and accessibility of the network."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Shared state",
      "content": "The account-based model relies on the shared mutable state, which is known to lead to complex semantics (and subtle million-dollar bugs) in the context of concurrent and distributed computation. Ergo's model is based on an immutable graph of transactions. This approach, inherited from Bitcoin, plays well with the concurrent and distributed nature of blockchains and facilitates light trustless clients."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Expressive Power",
      "content": "Ethereum advocated the execution of a Turing-complete language on the blockchain. It theoretically promised unlimited potential; however, severe limitations arose from excessive blockchain bloat, subtle multi-million dollar bugs, gas costs that limit contract complexity, and other such problems. Ergo, in contrast, extends UTXO to enable Turing completeness while limiting the complexity of the ErgoScript language itself. The same expressive power is achieved in a different, more semantically sound manner."
