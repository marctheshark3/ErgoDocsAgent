      "content": "The Ergo block, a critical structure in the Ergo blockchain, differs from many other blockchain systems by comprising four distinct sections (modifiers):\nHeader: Contains the minimal information necessary to synchronize the chain and validate Proof-of-Work (PoW) correctness. It includes cryptographic hashes (roots) of the other sections.\nBlock Transactions: Consists of the ordered sequence of transactions included within the block.\nADProofs: Contains Authenticated Dictionary proofs associated with the transactions in the BlockTransactions section. These proofs allow light clients to validate transactions against the UTXO set state root hash found in the header.\nExtension: Holds supplementary information. This includes interlinks (for NiPoPoWs) and, for blocks at the end of a voting epoch, the blockchain parameters resulting from miner voting."

      "content": "The Extension section functions as a key-value store capable of holding various data relevant to the block or protocol state.\nKeys are consistently 2 bytes long, and the maximum size for a value is 64 bytes. The total size of the Extension section must not exceed 32,768 bytes (previously 16,384, updated post-EIP-38).\nCertain key prefixes have predefined meanings:\n*   Parameters (0x00 prefix): If the first byte of the key is 0x00, the second byte identifies a specific blockchain parameter (e.g., block size limit, cost per byte). The value associated with this key represents the parameter's value. These are typically included only in blocks at the end of a voting epoch.\n*   Interlinks (0x01 prefix): Keys starting with 0x01 are used for storing the NiPoPoW interlinks vector. The second byte indicates the level k of the link. The value contains the actual block ID (32 bytes) representing the link at that level.\nOther key prefixes are available for future protocol extensions or application-specific data."
