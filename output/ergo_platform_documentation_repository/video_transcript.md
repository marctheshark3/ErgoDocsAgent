- A UTXO platform like Bitcoin
- Advanced scripting capabilities using Ergoscript
    - Functional programming using scala-like syntax
        - `INPUTS.exist({utxo:Box} => utxo.value >= 100})`
    - Conditional statements `If (condition) {block1} else {block2}`
    - Store data in [registers](registers.md) of UTXO (up to 10 registers)
- Enriched context
    - Allows multistage contracts using transaction chaining. ### Ergo’s approach

This is essentially the approach that Ergo takes, providing superior support for real-world financial agreements. It does this through:

1. Support for multi-stage contracts ([watch details for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3FlM_WOwBU)) 2.

#### Ergo’s approach
This is essentially the approach that Ergo takes, providing superior support for real-world financial agreements. It does this through:
Support for multi-stage contracts (watch details for developers)
A simple high-level language, ErgoScript, enabling clear descriptions of contractual logic
Support for formal verification of contracts for improved security guarantees (Ergo Platform deployed its first formally verified p2p crowdfunding contract just three months after the network launched)
Easy Oracle creation
Native support for complex signature schemes
In short, creating financial contracts on the blockchain isn’t just about the functionality you provide. It’s about making that functionality safe and accessible, as well as powerful. Ergo achieves this and more.
DeFi dApps have overloaded the Ethereum blockchain, causing long delays and soaring fees for transactions. Ethereum and many other platforms besides have researched and implemented fixes to address the lack of capacity. However, all of the solutions are imperfect in one way or another. Larger blocks are the obvious but clumsy fix, resulting in centralisation as fewer miners can afford the bandwidth, storage and CPU cycles to participate. Reducing the number of block validators – another approach taken to increase throughput – also necessarily centralises the blockchain. Sharding, while potentially very promising, has yet to be implemented successfully, and in some proposed implementations, breaks atomic composability because shards cannot communicate seamlessly.
Thus many of the ways projects seek to ensure their blockchains are fit for purpose result in greater centralisation or loss of critical functionality.
Marginal gains
Ergo’s developers are watching developments in the DeFi space closely, especially some of the proposals that aim to scale blockchains while maintaining security, decentralisation and atomic composability. In the meantime, there is much that can be done to improve blockchain capacity. Th...
