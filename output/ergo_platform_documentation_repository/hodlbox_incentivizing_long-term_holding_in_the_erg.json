The locked amount can range from 10 to 10,000 ERG, and these funds remain locked for a specified duration, either two years or until the value of ERG reaches $20. This mechanism provides an incentive for users to resist impulsive selling and promotes the practice of long-term holding in the Ergo ecosystem. ## NFT Rewards\n\nAs an added bonus, users receive NFTs corresponding to the amount they lock, allowing them to showcase their commitment on their profile pictures.",
