  "summary": "# Unspendable Scripts in ErgoScript In contrast to the [previous examples](anyone-can-spend.md), ErgoScript can also create programs at the opposite end of the flexibility spectrum that always evaluate to `false`. Here's an example of such a script:\n\n```scala\ntrue && false  // Corresponds to address m3iBKr65o53izn\n```\n\nThe script in the example above results in an address to which funds can be sent, but not spent. These scripts are referred to as **no-one-can-spend scripts** due to this characteristic. It's crucial to remember not to send funds to these addresses as they cannot be retrieved.",
