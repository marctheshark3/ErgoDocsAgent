## Summary
# Stablecoins

Blockchain assets can be extremely volatile. That’s why investors often seek digital assets which are pegged to national currencies. A Stablecoin is the most primitive integration of cryptocurrencies with the off-chain world. Until DAI, fiat custody services were provided by centralized services. The first example of a stable coin, USDT, is backed by [actual dollars](https://cryptobriefing.com/external-auditor-first-confirm-tethers-usdt-backing/) held in banks.

A Stablecoin is the most primitive integration of cryptocurrencies with the off-chain world. Until DAI, fiat custody services were provided by centralized services. The first example of a stable coin, USDT, is backed by actual dollars held in banks. However, for a decentralized financial system, we need other means of fiat-pegged currencies.
