## Summary
Ergo's storage rent mechanism also allows miners to take over valuable assets inside a UTXO if there are insufficient ERGs to pay rent On the positive side, this mechanism incentivizes miners by offering them additional rewards, making the Ergo blockchain more attractive and encouraging participation. This increased participation can enhance the network's security and overall health. However, there are drawbacks to this mechanism. Users who are not aware of the storage rent system or fail to maintain enough ERG in their UTXO may lose valuable assets unintentionally. EIP-33: Token burning during rent collection #68 is under discussion, which could potentially address some of these concerns in the future.
