ErgoTool outputs the error message with the information about the help command. This is a typical output of ErgoTool when one of the known commands is specified but used incorrectly. As we can learn from the message, the help. the command requires us to specify an additional <commandName> argument.

Run the following command to generate a new mnemonic phrase:\n$ ./ergo-tool.sh mnemonic          \nbird harbor wheat innocent business disease busy quick yellow trust time oil enter situate moon\nPlease write it down on paper and keep it in a safe and secret place. As an additional security measure, you can create a random mnemonic password. In some sense, it can serve as another non-vocabulary word in the mnemonic. A mnemonic password is optional and is used for additional security. If you decide to use a mnemonic password, you should also write it down and keep it a secret, probably different from a mnemonic one.\nImportant, both mnemonic phrases and mnemonic passwords are required to restore secret keys, if you lose any of them, then you will not be able to regenerate your master key again.\nNext, use the generated Mnemonic to create storage with a master secret key."
