Such a standard allows end users to move between different wallet software trivially and established the framework for a more cohesive ecosystem to grow.

      "content": "In BIP-44 the constant 0 is used for the external addresses and constant 1 for internal addresses (aka change addresses).\nFor EIP-3, we instead do not use constant 1 at all. Thus we do not support internal/change addresses, but only external addresses.\nAs such all wallets supporting EIP-3 should have any change within a transaction go back to the address using constant 0.\nThis decision was made to simplify the experience for end-users and solidify a cohesive standard for wallets to target in the Ergo ecosystem. A full-blown privacy-preserving mixer is already available within the ecosystem, ErgoMix, and thus the pseudo-anonymity provided by internal addresses is not particularly vital.\nThat said, in the future new wallets are more than welcome to create a new EIP for wallets that may wish to support internal addresses as well as an alternate standard (if valuable use cases arise)."
