  "summary": "Votes on foundational changes, such as block version, span 32 epochs and demand a 90% miner consensus. Everyday changes, like block size adjustments, require only a simple majority. Each block allows miners to cast votes for up to two everyday changes and one foundational change. These votes are included in the block's header. To vote \"Yes\" for a change at the beginning of an epoch, a miner places the change's identifier directly into the block header.",

A zero should be set in any unoccupied slot. Votes can be arranged in any sequence.\nFor example, if a miner proposes to increase the storage fee factor and also initiate a soft-fork, they would input (0, 1, 120) in the header slots."
