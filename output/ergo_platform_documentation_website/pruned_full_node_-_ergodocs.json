  "summary": "The Ergo Protocol Reference Client 5.0.13 introduced a new feature: bootstrapping using a verified UTXO set snapshot and NiPoPoWS. This feature allows you to achieve full node security on a standard laptop within minutes, eliminating the need to check approximately 95% of the blockchain. This addresses the increasing demands for downloading, storing, and processing the entire blockchain. This mode is akin to the fast-sync in Geth or Grothendieck and warp-mode in Parity, used by Ethereum protocol clients, but with more aggressive optimizations. Important: You cannot restore an old wallet with a pruned node.",

The recommended approach is to create a new wallet and transfer funds to it.\nAdd the following utxo and nipopow sections to your node configuration to enable UTXO Set Snapshots.\nergo {\n    node {\n        mining = false\n\n        utxo {\n           utxoBootstrap = true\n           storingUtxoSnapshots = 0\n        }\n        nipopow {\n           nipopowBootstrap = true\n           p2pNipopows = 2\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\nscorex {\n    restApi {\n        apiKeyHash = \"324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf\"\n    }\n}\nNote on Progress Reporting: Currently, the node may not provide detailed progress updates specifically during the download phase of the UTXO snapshot itself when utxoBootstrap = true. Synchronization progress for headers and subsequent blocks is typically visible via the node panel (/panel) or logs, but the snapshot download phase might appear as a period of inactivity before regular block processing resumes."
