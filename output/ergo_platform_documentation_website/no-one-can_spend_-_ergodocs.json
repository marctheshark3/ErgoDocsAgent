Here's an example of such a script: The script in the example above results in an address to which funds can be sent, but not spent. These scripts are referred to as no-one-can-spend scripts due to this characteristic. It's crucial to remember not to send funds to these addresses as they cannot be retrieved. Ergo features a concept known as 'garbage collection' or storage rent.",
