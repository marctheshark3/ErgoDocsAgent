### Building the Wallet from Source#
Ensure Node.js version 20.11 is installed before attempting to build Minotaur:
Clone the repository:
   git clone [emailÂ protected]:minotaur-ergo/minotaur-wallet.git

Navigate to the cloned directory and install dependencies:
   cd minotaur-wallet
npm install

Build the project with the following commands:
   npm run build
npx cap sync
npx cap update

   The last two commands synchronize the codebase for Android and iOS platforms. For desktop builds, synchronize the Electron code with:
   npx cap sync electron
npx cap update electron

#### Android#
Open the android directory within the project using Android Studio and proceed with the build process using the IDE or alternative build tools.

#### iOS#
iOS developers can open the project in Xcode and build the desired version directly from the IDE.

#### Desktop#
For desktop builds, enter the Electron directory and execute the following commands:
   npm run build
npm run electron:pack
npm run electron:make

#### MacOS#
Apple Silicon (M-series) users should opt for the arm64 build to avoid camera issues. If encountering a "damaged file" error, execute:
   sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/minotaur.app
