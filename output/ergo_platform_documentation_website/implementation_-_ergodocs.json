There is an open issue in the sigmastate-interpreter repository to support Merkle Trees natively, which would allow for direct handling of static data within ErgoScript, enhancing efficiency in various blockchain operations, such as proof-of-transaction and securing extension block data. Until this feature is fully integrated into sigmastate-interpreter, developers working in JVM-based environments can leverage scrypto, which provides essential cryptographic functionalities, including Merkle Tree management and Batch Proof generation and verification. For more details on the ongoing integration efforts, you can refer to the GitHub issue #296 in the Ergo repository. Now, let's delve into the practical steps of using Merkle Batch Proofs in Ergo.",
