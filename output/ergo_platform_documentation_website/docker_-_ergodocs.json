Every default config value would be overwritten with corresponding value in myergo.conf. MAX_HEAP variable can be used to control how much memory can the node consume.\nThis command also would store your data in /path/on/host/to/ergo/data on host system, and open ports 9030 (node communication) globally and 9053 (REST API) locally on host system. The /path/on/host/to/ergo/data directory must has 777 permissions or has owner/group numeric id equal to 9052 to be writable by container, as ergo user inside Docker image (please refer to Dockerfile).\nErgo node works normally behind NAT, so you can keep closed your 9030 port, hence other nodes could not discover and connect to yours one, only your node could initiate connections.\nIt is also a good practice to keep closed REST API port 9053, and connect to your node from inside another container in the same Docker network (this case not covered by this short quick start manual)."
