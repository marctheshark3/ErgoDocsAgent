These prompts are designed to provide clear, concise information about the risks, requirements, and assumptions associated with each protocol, enabling users to make informed decisions.\nKYA prompts typically cover the following areas:\nSecurity Assumptions: Highlighting the underlying security mechanisms, such as cryptographic algorithms, consensus models, and trusted parties.\nEconomic Assumptions: Providing details on tokenomics, incentives, and economic factors that affect the protocol's stability and sustainability.\nUser Responsibilities: Outlining what actions users need to take to ensure their safety, such as managing private keys or understanding potential risks in smart contracts.\nExternal Dependencies: Identifying any reliance on third-party services or external data, such as oracles, that could impact the protocol's functionality.\nTransparency: Ensuring that users are aware of any opaque components or centralized elements within a supposedly decentralized protocol.\nProjects like SigmaFi have adopted KYA prompts, helping users assess critical assumptions and understand the underlying technology. These prompts serve as a valuable tool in empowering users, promoting transparency, and mitigating risks in the DeFi landscape.\nFor more, see Building a standard KYA Prompt."
