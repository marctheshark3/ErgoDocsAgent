  "summary": "ErgoNames is a decentralized naming system for the Ergo blockchain, allowing users to register human-readable names that can be associated with their Ergo addresses. This improves the user experience by making it easier to send and receive transactions using memorable names instead of long, complex addresses. ErgoNames is an important project for improving the usability and adoption of the Ergo ecosystem. By providing a user-friendly naming system, it reduces the friction of using Ergo addresses and enables a better overall experience for users. The project is actively being developed by the Ergo community, with contributions from various developers.",
