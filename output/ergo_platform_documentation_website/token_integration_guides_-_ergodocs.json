Whether you're bridging from Ergo to Cardano, Cardano to Ethereum, or any other supported network combination, these steps will help ensure your token is properly integrated across ecosystems. Tokens can be bridged between any networks connected via Rosen Bridge. This means: The world's largest independent crypto data aggregator. Generally easier to get listed compared to CoinMarketCap but still requires significant volume and legitimate activity.",
