For implementation examples, refer to: Peer features are properties that describe a peer. A peer can have multiple features, which are embedded in a handshake message and remain constant throughout the connection. Features are optional, and a peer can add new ones. If a feature is unrecognized by another peer, it will be skipped.",

Features are optional, and a peer can add new ones. If a feature is unrecognized by another peer, it will be skipped. The format of the feature is arbitrary, and any number can be added to the handshake, subject to the handshake message size limit of 8 KB.\nBefore version 3.3.7, the reference client only supported the \"mode feature\" (which describes the operating regime of the peer). Since version 3.3.7, a new feature that describes network magic and a pseudorandom session ID has been added.\nExample Implementation:\nIn the Ergonnection library, the Feature class represents individual peer features with an id and data. The features are serialized and deserialized to be included in handshake messages, ensuring that they can be transmitted and interpreted correctly during the handshake."
