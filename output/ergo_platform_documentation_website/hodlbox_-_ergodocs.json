  "summary": "Hodlbox is a unique platform designed to encourage long-term holding of Ergo (ERG) by offering users the opportunity to purchase \"treasure chests\" with varying locking options. The locked amount can range from 10 to 10,000 ERG, and these funds remain locked for a specified duration, either two years or until the value of ERG reaches $20. This mechanism provides an incentive for users to resist impulsive selling and promotes the practice of long-term holding in the Ergo ecosystem. As an added bonus, users receive NFTs corresponding to the amount they lock, allowing them to showcase their commitment on their profile pictures. These NFTs serve as a visual representation of the user's dedication to the Ergo ecosystem and their belief in the long-term potential of the project.",
