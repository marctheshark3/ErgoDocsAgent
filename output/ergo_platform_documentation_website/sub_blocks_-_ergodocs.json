This change reduces typical onchain confirmation times from about 2 minutes to roughly 2 seconds, achieving a 17\u00c3\u0097 improvement in detecting transaction failures and transforming the current competitive mempool into a more cooperative environment.

      "content": "Sub-blocks (Input Blocks):\n  These are block candidates generated with a lower difficulty threshold than full blocks. They are produced approximately once per second and carry most transaction data. This allows transactions to propagate and confirm much faster.\n\n\nOrdering Blocks:\n  These are the traditional full blocks of Ergo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proof-of-work system, now renamed as ordering blocks. They are generated roughly every 2 minutes and maintain the overall consensus and security of the blockchain.\nNote: The naming \u00e2\u0080\u009cinput blocks\u00e2\u0080\u009d (or sub-blocks) and \u00e2\u0080\u009cordering blocks\u00e2\u0080\u009d was proposed in detail in this document."

These changes provide users with near-instant confirmations and faster failure detection, thereby offering a smoother and more efficient experience on the network.\nFor a deep dive into the technical details behind these changes, see the technical details."
