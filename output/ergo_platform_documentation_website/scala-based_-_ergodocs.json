  "summary": "Since ErgoScript is a subset of Scala and rigorously tested for equivalence within the sigmastate-interpreter repository, you can leverage standard Scala debugging tools and techniques to test and debug your contract logic off-chain. The core idea is to represent your ErgoScript contract logic as Scala code, typically within a testing environment like ScalaTest or JUnit, often using frameworks like Appkit or the testing utilities within sigmastate-interpreter itself. This allows you to simulate the blockchain context (Context, Box, Transaction, etc.) and execute your contract logic within a standard JVM debugging environment. The AssetsAtomicExchange.scala tests within the sigmastate-interpreter repository provide practical examples of this pattern. Breakpoints can be set within the proposition definitions (which contain Scala code mirroring ErgoScript), and the corresponding tests run in debug mode to step through the logic.",

Appkit's ErgoContract compilation or direct use of SigmaBuilder can be employed.\n\n\nSimulate Context:\nCreate mock Context, Box, and Transaction objects representing the specific scenario you want to test. Populate input/output boxes, registers, context variables, and blockchain parameters (like HEIGHT) as needed.\n\n\nSet Breakpoints:\nUse your Scala IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) to set breakpoints within the Scala code representing your contract logic or the test setup code that invokes it.\n\n\nRun in Debug Mode:\nExecute the specific test case using the IDE's debugger.\n\n\nInspect and Step Through:\nWhen the debugger halts at a breakpoint, you can:\nInspect the values of variables (including simulated context data).\nStep through the code line by line.\nEvaluate expressions.\nValidate the logic flow and intermediate results."
