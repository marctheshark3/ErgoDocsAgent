      "content": "Create a Folder: Start by creating a dedicated folder for your Ergo node files (e.g., ergo in your home directory).\nObtain the Ergo Client JAR: You have two main options:\nDownload (Recommended): Visit the Ergo GitHub releases page and download the latest stable ergo-<version>.jar file. This is the simplest method for most users. Place the downloaded JAR file in your ergo folder.\nBuild from Source: If you need a specific version (like a Release Candidate) or want to contribute to development, you can compile the JAR yourself. This requires Git, JDK, and SBT.\nSee the detailed guide: Building the Ergo Node from Source\nNote: Building development versions might require handling SNAPSHOT dependencies. Refer to the build guide and the specific SNAPSHOT Dependencies guide if you encounter issues."

      "content": "Create a Configuration File (ergo.conf):\n\nIn your ergo folder, create a text file named ergo.conf.\nThis file overrides default node settings. Only add settings you need to change.\nStart with a basic configuration (adjust apiKeyHash later if needed):\n    ergo {\n    node {\n        mining = false // Disable mining unless intended\n    }\n}\nscorex {\n    restApi {\n        // Set a secure API key hash for API access\n        // Example hash for password \"hello\":\n        apiKeyHash = \"324dcf027dd4a30a932c441f365a25e86b173defa4b8e58948253471b81b72cf\" \n    }\n}\n\nFor more configuration options, see the Configuration Files documentation.\n\n\n\nLaunch Your Node:\n\nOpen a terminal or command prompt in your ergo folder.\nRun the node using the java -jar command, specifying the JAR file, network (--mainnet or --testnet), and configuration file (-c). Allocate sufficient memory using -Xmx.\n    # Example for mainnet with 4GB RAM allocated\njava -jar -Xmx4G ergo-<version>.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf \n\nAdjust -Xmx4G based on your system's available RAM (e.g., -Xmx2G, -Xmx8G). More RAM generally improves performance, especially during sync.\nReplace ergo-<version>.jar with the actual name of your downloaded or built JAR file.\n\n\n\nWait for Initialization & Synchronization:\n\nThe node will start up and begin synchronizing with the Ergo network. This process downloads and validates the blockchain history.\nSynchronization can take a significant amount of time (hours to days) depending on your hardware, network speed, and the chosen Node Mode. Be patient."
