## Ergo Development Roadmap & History#
Ergo is a blockchain platform designed to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment for the development of decentralized applications and financial tools. This roadmap outlines the key milestones and objectives for the development and growth of the Ergo ecosystem.

### Resources#
Vision & Key Features
Ergo is a cutting-edge smart contract platform that provides secure, accessible, and decentralized financial tools to empower ordinary people. Utilizing a sophisticated scripting language and advanced cryptographic features, Ergo builds on fundamental blockchain principles to transform the concept of Contractual Money.
Ergo aims to establish itself as a mineable digital asset akin to "Digital Gold 2.0," supporting trustless derivatives and dynamic contracts. The development of Ergoâs DeFi ecosystem and the integration of sidechains will broaden the decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply, enhancing financial inclusivity and accessibility worldwide.
Ergoâs commitment to decentralization, fairness, and accessibility is evident in its adoption of the Autolykos Proof-of-Work protocol, which facilitates a user-friendly environment where lightweight clients can interact directly with the blockchain, making Ergo a practical and programmable currency ready for use.

 eUTXO Model: Allows UTXOs to carry arbitrary data and complex scripts, enabling advanced smart contracts
 Autolykos PoW Algorithm: ASIC-resistant and designed for fair mining, promoting decentralization
 Emission Schedule: Ensures a stable and predictable supply of ERG tokens
 NiPoPoWs (Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work): Enables efficient light clients, log-space mining, trustless sidechains, and enhances accessibility and decentralization by allowing mobile SPV clients and lite full nodes
 ErgoScript: Supports clear and concise smart contract development with Î£-protocols
 Storage Rent: Mitigates blockchain bloat, incentivizes efficient storage usage, and contributes to long-term economic sustainability
 Turing-Complete Smart Contracts: Allows for complex on-chain computations and advanced dApp development
 Long-Term Economic Sustainability: Ensured through storage rent, transaction fees from DeFi, and subpool mining

Developing Digital Gold 2.0 and its Infrastructure
The following is adapted from this post on the R&D DAO for Ergo Core thread. 
Vision
The Ergo Core Dev DAO envisions Ergo as Digital Gold 2.0, a mineable digital commodity with trustless derivatives and expressive contracts. By building upon Ergo's robust DeFi ecosystem and introducing sidechains, we aim to expand the decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply, creating a more inclusive and accessible financial system for the Ergo community and beyond.
Completed Milestones
The Ergo platform, with the support of the Ergo Foundation and community developers, has already made significant strides in developing its infrastructure and DeFi ecosystem. This includes launching basic infrastructure such as wallets and explorers, as well as a wide range of DeFi tools and trustless derivatives, such as:

 SigmaUSD stablecoin (Djed protocol)
 Spectrum DEX (AMM-based)
 ErgoMixer (non-interactive, non-custodial mixer)
 ErgoAuctionHouse (peer-to-peer auctions)
 SigmaFi (peer-to-peer loans via bonds)
 Duckpools (lending pools)
 ErgoRaffle (decentralized crowdfunding)
 EXLE (uncollateralized lending)
 SigmaO (trustless options)
 HodlCoin (trustless ERG derivative with non-declining price)
 AuctionCoin (emission via auctions)
 Oracle Pools (federated transparent data providing)
 Rosen Bridge (two-layered federated bridge)

These tools collectively contribute to the creation of more trustless collateral through various means such as AuctionCoin, OptionCoin, and fair initial mining offerings. As a result, Ergo's decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply continue to grow. It's worth noting that the entire DeFi ecosystem on Ergo is built upon its unique ErgoTree/ErgoScript contractual layer, also known as Sigma, which provides a secure and flexible foundation for the development of complex financial applications.
Upcoming Milestones
Looking ahead, key milestones include:

 The launch of new DeFi tool...
