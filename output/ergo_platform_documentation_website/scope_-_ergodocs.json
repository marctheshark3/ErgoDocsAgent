This approach promotes a gradual and non-disruptive evolution of the Ergo Platform, fostering stability and continuity for the ecosystem.\n\n\nOpen-Source and Permissive Licensing: The Foundation is committed to maximizing the number of valuable ecosystem developments accomplished in open-source with the least permissive license possible. This philosophy encourages collaboration, transparency, and community-driven innovation, while minimizing barriers to entry and fostering a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem.\n\n\nPrivacy and Trustless Environments: The Foundation is dedicated to helping build trustless environments, smart contracts, and payment frameworks for the public with privacy in mind. Ergo's strong focus on privacy and decentralization aligns with the Foundation's mission to empower individuals and promote financial sovereignty.\n\n\nCommunity-Driven: The Foundation believes that the Treasury should be distributed mainly to the community, including freelancers, hackers, experts, and enthusiasts. This approach recognizes the vital role of the community in driving innovation and growth, and aims to cultivate a thriving and self-sustaining ecosystem.\nThe Ergo Foundation's Future\nPlease see this page for more information on the long-term goals of The Foundation."

      "heading": "Promotion and Outreach#",
      "content": "The Foundation aims to promote the adoption of Ergo through various outreach and promotional efforts. While its operations in this area are conservative, it does fund a select few roles for areas not currently met by the community, such as:\nAngie Har, Editorial & Events Manager (salaried)\nAndy Lowe, YouTube Manager (hourly)\nSean Rice, Editor (hourly)\nEva Qing, Chinese Outreach Manager (hourly)\nMarcelo Roncatti, Branding Advisor (hourly)\nWriters (via paid bounties)\nTheir efforts ensure ample information is available about ongoing developments on Ergo via blog posts and social media, as well as the promotion and operation of various events, such as Ergo Summit and ErgoHack. These initiatives aim to raise awareness, foster community engagement, and attract new users and developers to the Ergo ecosystem.\nWen 'Marketing?'\nThe Ergo Foundation takes a principled approach to marketing and promotion, focusing on empowering community-driven initiatives and fostering organic growth. For ethical and legal reasons, the Foundation does not directly control outward marketing efforts. Instead, it aims to support and enable community-driven innovation through initiatives like the Ecosystem Grant Framework and donations to community-led projects like the Sigmanauts.\nNetwork effects have been a significant driver of value creation in the tech industry, accounting for approximately 70% of value creation over the past 23 years. For a grassroots, third-generation blockchain like Ergo, this figure is likely even higher. While the Ergo Foundation strives to lay the foundations and help ignite community outreach and compounding growth, the ultimate promotion and adoption of Ergo rests principally on the shoulders of the community. The Foundation's role is to empower and support the community's efforts, fostering a self-sustaining and vibrant ecosystem.

      "heading": "Development#",
      "content": "The Ergo Foundation's relationship with development is primarily focused on areas where there is a demand not met by the community. This role is expected to diminish over time as the community grows and takes on more development responsibilities. The Foundation recognizes the importance of fostering a self-sustaining and community-driven ecosystem, where the community plays an increasingly prominent role in driving development efforts.\nSome Ergo Foundation members also hold developer positions, although their development activities are separate from their foundation involvement. For transparency, these roles are listed below:\nMorphic manages JVM-related developers (Wallet devs, Scala devs, etc.) and the sigmastate-interpreter. (salaried)\nMark Glasgow manages this documentation and various other developer-adjacent tasks. (salaried)\nMohammad Hasan Samadani (mhs_sam) manages a team of graduates and PhD students who have produced Ergo Raffle, ErgoWell, Minotaur-wallet, and Rosen Bridge. (rewarded until April 2024 - now working on a volunteer basis)\nFleet-sdk is managed by Alison Robson (anon_br). (salaried)\nAdditionally, outwith the EF members, we fund a few roles in development.\nDmitry Usov manages the Ergo website and works on various other projects such as the DexyGold front-end. (salaried)\nThe rest of the funds spent on development go towards bounties on the repositories given below\nThe Ergo Foundation also pays for the hosting and bandwidth costs for several pieces of infrastructure such as the website and explorer. This support ensures the availability and reliability of critical resources for the Ergo ecosystem."

There are two levels of funding:\nDevelopment Funding: Involves funding for research, development, maintenance, and bug fixing.\nMaintenance Funding: Involves only bug fixing and minor issue resolution to support existing applications. Repositories in this category are considered deprecated. While being part of the core ecosystem, they will receive maintenance support for existing applications.

By providing financial assistance through grants, the Foundation aims to empower developers, researchers, and community members to explore new ideas and contribute to the overall advancement of the Ergo platform."

      "heading": "Exchange Listings#",
      "content": "For a detailed overview of current efforts, view the public grist.\nThe Ergo Foundation, as a legal entity, is primarily responsible for liaising with centralized exchanges. Ergo has been listed on several exchanges, including three Tier 1 exchanges (KuCoin, gate.io, Huobi). A Tier 1 exchange is defined as an exchange that appears in the top 10 of exchange ranking sites such as defillama.com/cexs.\nExchange discussions and details are typically confidential due to Non-Disclosure Agreements ('NDA'). However, we can share some general insights:\nListings are usually expensive.\nExchanges generally do not buy liquidity or any of the native tokens or coins on the open market. Instead, a third-party Market Maker ('MM') is used, which has access to an API with a preallocated amount of ERG and USDT to create a liquid market. The MM can only buy/sell and lacks the credentials to withdraw assets.\nThe Ergo Foundation has approached all major exchanges, and none have been rejected due to high costs.\nIf you're wondering why certain coins are listed and Ergo is not, it could be due to several reasons:\nThey are a native asset on an already integrated chain (e.g., ERC20, Cosmos), which requires less effort to add and maintain.\nThey may have venture-capitalist funding and connections, which can be leveraged for early listings.\nThey may have a smaller public distribution than ERG and can negotiate with exchanges for a percentage of their total supply.\nThey may be less complex than Ergo, with no native asset support, no need to worry about UTXO dust, etc.\nThey may be older than Ergo and were listed during the last bear market.\nEven though they are a unique Layer-1, they may only have a wrapped asset (e.g., on BSC) listed.\nThe Ergo Foundation is committed to expanding Ergo's presence on exchanges. However, certain factors such as low volume or market cap can affect our eligibility for listing on some platforms. This is not due to a lack of effort or resources but rather the nature of the ..."
