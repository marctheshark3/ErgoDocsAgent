## Summary
Ergo's governance model is designed to facilitate network upgrades and parameter adjustments through a decentralized voting mechanism among miners. This approach ensures the long-term economic stability and adaptability of the Ergo network. Ergo implements various measures to prevent disruptive hard forks, such as pushing complexity to the application layer and enabling many features to be implemented via soft-forks. For more information on Ergo's forking mechanism, see the Forking page. Miners can vote to change specific protocol parameters, as outlined in the table on the Forking page.

Ergo's governance model is designed to facilitate network upgrades and parameter adjustments through a decentralized voting mechanism among miners. This approach ensures the long-term economic stability and adaptability of the Ergo network.
Ergo implements various measures to prevent disruptive hard forks, such as pushing complexity to the application layer and enabling many features to be implemented via soft-forks. For more information on Ergo's forking mechanism, see the Forking page.
Miners can vote to change specific protocol parameters, as outlined in the table on the Forking page. Soft-forking changes that require 90% miner support can alter many aspects of Ergo, excluding critical elements like the maximum supply.
For detailed information on the voting process, including voting mechanics, system constants, and how to propose and vote for changes, refer to the dedicated Voting page.
