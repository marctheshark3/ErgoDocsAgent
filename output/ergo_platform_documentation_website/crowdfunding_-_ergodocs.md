Crowdfunding for common infrastructure and tooling on the Ergo network is a way for users, developers, and miners to work together to fund and advance the network far into the future.
We already have crowdfunding on the Ergo blockchain via Ergo Raffle; this allows projects to host 'Raffles' with a prize percentage allocated to the lucky donor. 
ErgoWell is a project meant to be used for investing in ventures trying to raise money through crowdfunding.
