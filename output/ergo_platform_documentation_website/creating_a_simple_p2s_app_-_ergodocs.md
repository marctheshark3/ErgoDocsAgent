Crowdfunding: This script provides a method to raise funds within a specified timeframe. The funds can only be accessed if the fundraising goal is met by the deadline. If the deadline passes without reaching the goal, the funds can be returned to the backers. See the script on Pluto Monkey P2S.


3-out-of-5 Threshold Signature: This script allows the creation of a multi-signature wallet that requires the agreement of at least three out of five participants to authorize transactions. The script can be found on Pluto Monkey P2S.
