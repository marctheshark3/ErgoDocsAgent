  "summary": "In Ergo, modifiers (blocks, transactions, etc.) progress through several states during the synchronization process: The primary goal of the synchronization process is to transition necessary modifiers from the Unknown state to the Held state, thereby bringing the node's view of the blockchain up-to-date with the network. The transition of a modifier from the Unknown state to the Requested state can occur in different ways, depending on the current node status (bootstrapping/stable) and the type of modifier. The Inv (inventory) protocol is a communication protocol used during the synchronization process. It involves the following steps: Creating Inv Message: An Inv message contains pairs of (ModifierTypeId, Seq[ModifierId]). When Node A sends an Inv message to Node B, it signals that Node A possesses the listed modifiers and is prepared to send them upon request from Node B. Broadcasting Inv Message: A node broadcasts Inv messages primarily in two scenarios: Receiving Inv Message: Upon receiving an Inv message from a peer, a node: Headers synchronization is the initial step in the synchronization process.",

Persistent Modifiers (like Headers, BlockTransactions, ADProofs, Extension) are held by the History component, while Ephemeral Modifiers (like Transactions) are held by the Mempool before being included in a block.\nInvalid: The modifier has been determined to be permanently invalid according to consensus rules.\nThe primary goal of the synchronization process is to transition necessary modifiers from the Unknown state to the Held state, thereby bringing the node's view of the blockchain up-to-date with the network."

This helps propagate new information quickly across the network, especially when nodes are already synchronized.\nIn response to receiving an ErgoSyncInfo message from a peer (see Headers Synchronization below).\n\n\n\nReceiving Inv Message: Upon receiving an Inv message from a peer, a node:\n\nFilters the list to identify modifiers it doesn't already know about (i.e., those currently in the Unknown state).\nRequests these unknown modifiers from the peer that sent the Inv message.\nTransitions the state of these requested modifiers to Requested."

      "heading": "Headers Synchronization#",
      "content": "Headers synchronization is the initial step in the synchronization process. It ensures that a node's headers chain is in sync with the network. The process involves the following steps:\nSending ErgoSyncInfo: Periodically (every syncInterval), a node calculates and sends an ErgoSyncInfo message to a selection of its peers (peersToSyncWith()). This message contains the IDs of the last ErgoSyncInfo.MaxBlockIds headers in its current best chain, allowing peers to compare chains.\n\n\nTriggering ErgoSyncInfo: To speed up synchronization, a node might also send an ErgoSyncInfo message more frequently if its headers chain is lagging behind the network's perceived best chain, but the number of headers it still needs to request is relatively small (e.g., less than desiredInvObjects / 2).\n\n\nReceiving ErgoSyncInfo: Upon receiving an ErgoSyncInfo message from a peer, a node compares the received header IDs with its own chain to determine the relative status (OtherNodeSyncingStatus: Younger, Older, Equal, Nonsense, or Unknown). Based on this comparison, it identifies any headers the sender might be missing from its own chain.\n\n\nResponding with Inv: The node then constructs and sends an Inv message back to the original sender, containing the IDs of up to maxInvObjects headers that the sender appears to be missing. This helps the sender catch up."

      "heading": "Block Section Synchronization#",
      "content": "Block section synchronization is a crucial step that occurs after applying headers. A node synchronizes block sections (BlockTransactions, Extension, and ADProofs), the amount and composition of which may vary based on node settings. The process involves the following steps:\nIdentifying Needed Modifiers: Periodically (every syncInterval), a node determines the next set of block sections (BlockTransactions, Extension, ADProofs) it needs to download (nextModifiersToDownload()). This typically corresponds to the headers it has received but for which it lacks the full block data, starting from its current best fully validated block height.\n\n\nRequesting Modifiers: The node requests these needed modifiers from random peers (as it doesn't know which specific peer has them). The state of these modifiers transitions to Requested.\n\n\nTriggering Downloads: To speed up synchronization, the node might also request nextModifiersToDownload() more frequently if its header chain is synchronized but it's lagging behind in downloading block sections, provided the number of pending sections is small (e.g., less than desiredInvObjects / 2).\n\n\nApplying Block Header (Triggering Download): When a node successfully applies a new block header while its header chain is considered synchronized, the History component might return ProgressInfo indicating which block sections (ToDownload) are now needed to fully validate and apply this new block and potentially older blocks.\n\n\nProcessing ToDownload Request: When the NodeViewSynchronizer (NVS) receives this ToDownload information (either from periodic checks or header application), it requests the necessary modifiers from random peers, transitioning their state to Requested."

      "heading": "Transition from Requested to Received#",
      "content": "The transition from the Requested state to the Received state involves the following steps:\nTracking Requests: When a node requests a modifier from a specific peer, it records this request (modifier ID and peer) in its DeliveryTracker. It also schedules a CheckDelivery message to itself after a deliveryTimeout.\n\n\nReceiving Modifiers: When a node receives a modifier:\n\nIt checks if the modifier was requested from the sending peer using the DeliveryTracker.\nIf it was requested, the NodeViewSynchronizer (NVS) attempts to parse and perform initial validation on the received data.\n\n\n\nHandling Invalid Modifiers:\n\nIf the received data fails parsing or initial validation (e.g., incorrect format, size limits exceeded), the NVS penalizes the sending peer and transitions the modifier's state to Invalid.\nIf the peer provided syntactically correct but semantically incorrect modifier bytes (which might fail later validation stages), the NVS penalizes the peer, and the modifier might revert to Unknown or be marked Invalid depending on the failure type.\n\n\n\nProcessing Valid Modifiers: If the modifier passes initial parsing and validation, the NVS sends it to the NodeViewHolder (NVH) for further processing and transitions the modifier's state to Received.\n\n\nChecking Delivery Timeout: When the scheduled CheckDelivery message is processed:\n\nIf the modifier is already in the Received or Held state, no action is needed.\nIf the modifier is still in the Requested state (i.e., not delivered within the timeout), the node might retry the request a few times (maxDeliveryChecks).\nIf delivery ultimately fails after retries, the node penalizes the peer from which it was requested (unless it was requested from a random peer initially) and transitions the modifier's state back to Unknown so it can be requested again later, potentially from a different peer."

      "heading": "Transition from Received to Held#",
      "content": "The transition from the Received state to the Held state involves the following steps:\nReceiving Modifiers: When the NodeViewHolder (NVH) receives new modifiers (in the Received state) from the NVS, it stores them temporarily in its modifiersCache.\n\n\nApplying Modifiers: The NVH attempts to apply modifiers from the cache to the History and State components in the correct order (respecting dependencies).\n\n\nHandling Successful Application: For every modifier successfully applied (passing all validation rules and updating History/State), the NVH publishes a SyntacticallySuccessfulModifier event. Upon receiving this event, the NVS transitions the modifier's state to Held.\n\n\nHandling Cache Size Limit: If the modifiersCache exceeds its size limit after attempting applications, the NVH removes older or less relevant modifiers from the cache.\n\n\nHandling Processing Results: After attempting to apply modifiers, the NVH publishes a ModifiersProcessingResult message listing which modifiers were successfully applied and which were removed from the cache (potentially because they were invalid or their dependencies weren't met yet). When the NVS receives this message, it transitions any modifiers that were removed from the cache without being successfully applied back to the Unknown state, allowing them to be potentially requested and processed again later. Modifiers that failed validation might be transitioned to Invalid."
