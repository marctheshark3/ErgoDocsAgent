## Summary
Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKs) are advanced cryptographic techniques that allow one party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself, and without requiring real-time interaction between the prover and verifier. NIZKs in Ergo are primarily implemented through Sigma Protocols (Î£-protocols), which provide a powerful and flexible approach to zero-knowledge proofs. These protocols are a cornerstone of Ergo's privacy and cryptographic infrastructure. Non-Interactive: Proofs can be verified without direct communication Zero-Knowledge: No information about the secret is revealed Composable: Can be combined using logical operators like AND, OR, and THRESHOLD Ergo supports several fundamental zero-knowledge proof types: Discrete Logarithm Proofs Diffie-Hellman Tuple Proofs Ergo makes proofs non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir transformation, which converts interactive proofs into non-interactive ones by using a cryptographic hash function.

## Content
### Overview#
Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (NIZKs) are advanced cryptographic techniques that allow one party to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself, and without requiring real-time interaction between the prover and verifier.

### Theoretical Foundation#
NIZKs in Ergo are primarily implemented through Sigma Protocols (Î£-protocols), which provide a powerful and flexible approach to zero-knowledge proofs. These protocols are a cornerstone of Ergo's privacy and cryptographic infrastructure.

#### Key Characteristics#
Non-Interactive: Proofs can be verified without direct communication

Unlike traditional interactive zero-knowledge proofs, NIZKs can be verified asynchronously
Reduces computational overhead and network complexity



Zero-Knowledge: No information about the secret is revealed

Cryptographically guarantees that only the validity of a statement is proven
Protects sensitive information while maintaining verifiability



Composable: Can be combined using logical operators like AND, OR, and THRESHOLD

Enables creation of complex cryptographic conditions
Supports advanced smart contract logic and privacy-preserving protocols

### Cryptographic Primitives#
Ergo supports several fundamental zero-knowledge proof types:
Discrete Logarithm Proofs

Prove knowledge of a secret key without revealing it
Fundamental to Schnorr signature verification
Implemented using proveDlog() predicate in ErgoScript



Diffie-Hellman Tuple Proofs

Prove equality of discrete logarithms across different generators
Enables privacy-preserving key exchange and contract designs
Critical for advanced cryptographic protocols

#### Fiat-Shamir Transformation#
Ergo makes proofs non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir transformation, which converts interactive proofs into non-interactive ones by using a cryptographic hash function.
Key steps:
Transform an interactive proof into a non-interactive version
Use a cryptographic hash function to generate a challenge
Eliminates the need for real-time communication between prover and verifier

#### Proof Composition#
Sigma protocols can be combined to create complex proofs:
// Example of a threshold signature proof
val thresholdProof = prove {
  atLeast(
    3,  // Minimum number of signatures required
    Coll(
      PK("pubkey1"),
      PK("pubkey2"),
      PK("pubkey3"),
      PK("pubkey4"),
      PK("pubkey5")
    )
  )
}

#### Privacy-Preserving Techniques#
Ring Signatures

Prove one of multiple possible signers without revealing the exact signer
Enables anonymous transactions
Detailed in Ring Signatures documentation



Threshold Signatures

Require k-out-of-n participants to sign
Supports multi-party computational scenarios
Explored in Threshold Signatures documentation



Stealth Addresses

Generate one-time addresses for enhanced transaction privacy
Prevent linking of transactions to a specific public address
Crucial for maintaining financial privacy

#### Mixer Protocols#
ZeroJoin demonstrates a practical application:
- Uses ring signatures and Diffie-Hellman tuples
- Restores fungibility of digital tokens
- Provides non-interactive, trustless mixing
- Detailed in Mixer Protocol documentation

### Security Considerations#
Based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem
Requires careful implementation to prevent potential vulnerabilities
Extensive test coverage in Ergo's cryptographic implementations
Relies on well-established cryptographic assumptions

### Related Cryptographic Concepts#
