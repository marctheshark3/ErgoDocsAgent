  "summary": "Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are known for their scalability and reduced error rates. However, Ethereum's account model offers the advantages of persistent storage and a shared global context. Multi-Stage Contracts utilize a technique involving transaction trees to mimic persistent storage in UTXO-based systems. This is achieved by interlinking multiple UTXOs, each containing snippets of code, to create extensive multi-stage protocols. This approach introduces on-chain computations and enables the execution of parallel actions within smart contracts.",
