This is often the most effective way to step through logic off-chain.\nOn-Chain Mechanisms (Limited): Understand the limited tools available for insights during on-chain execution, such as the experimental debug() function and analyzing transaction failure logs.\nExternal Tools & Simulators: Utilize off-chain simulators (like the Spectrum Finance simulator) and other tools (SDK playgrounds, online editors) to test and analyze script behavior in controlled environments."
