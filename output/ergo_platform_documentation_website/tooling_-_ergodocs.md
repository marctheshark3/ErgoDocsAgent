## ErgoScript Tooling#
ErgoScript is a powerful and flexible language for creating smart contracts on the Ergo blockchain. As with any programming language, having the right tools can greatly enhance the development experience and productivity. This page provides an overview of various tools, resources, and examples to help you get started with ErgoScript development.

### Introduction#
ErgoScript is a domain-specific language designed specifically for the Ergo blockchain. It is inspired by Scala and allows developers to create secure and efficient smart contracts. While ErgoScript is not Turing-complete, it can be used to build Turing-complete applications by leveraging the extended UTXO model of the Ergo blockchain.
The ErgoScript ecosystem offers a wide range of tools and resources to help developers at all levels, from beginners to experienced professionals. These tools include playgrounds, tutorials, courses, explanations, references, and examples.
