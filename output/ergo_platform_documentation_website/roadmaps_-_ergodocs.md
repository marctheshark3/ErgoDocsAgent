## Summary
Join our discussions on scaling on Telegram or #layer2 on discord. We welcome all insights and contributions. With the successful integration of UTXO set snapshots and Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs) for ultra-fast bootstrapping in the pruned full node, our focus has now shifted towards optimizing this implementation. We are also exploring ways to further increase block limits for miners, given the live status of the pruned full node. Summarised from Kushti, 7 Aug, 2023

## Ergo Scaling Roadmap#
Join our discussions on scaling on Telegram or #layer2 on discord. We welcome all insights and contributions.

### Current Focus#
With the successful integration of UTXO set snapshots and Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs) for ultra-fast bootstrapping in the pruned full node, our focus has now shifted towards optimizing this implementation. We are also exploring ways to further increase block limits for miners, given the live status of the pruned full node.

### Recent Developments#
(TBA) Planning for Node V6 & scalability improvements
(WIP) Development of SPV Client
Pruned Full Node is now live
Release of Node V5
GetBlok released the Plasma Library
Plasma Tutorials have been published

##### Phase 1: Foundations#
Start with the basic design of Ergo as digital gold (commodity money).
Introduce programmability features including:
Crypto contracts
Stealth addresses
Arbitrarily complex signatures
Mixing schemes
Position Ergo as a basis for unstoppable, grassroots economies, serving as a decentralized central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the people.

##### Phase 2: Initial Experiments#
Conduct initial experiments to test functionality and user engagement.
Evaluate the outcomes considering the initial motivations.

##### Phase 3: Defining Adoption#
Clarify the term "adoption" as it is often ambiguous in industry discussions.
Develop metrics or KPIs to measure adoption success.

##### Phase 4: Scaling and Optimization#
Peer-to-peer (P2P) level optimizations and rework.
Consider pre-block commitments to transaction ordering (sub-blocks).
Aim to increase transactions per second (TPS) while maintaining security.

##### Constraints for Scaling#
Limitations include requirements for a flat P2P network running on commodity hardware.
No use of centralized or "bankster" data centers for scalability.

##### Phase 5: Offloading Solutions#
Propose options for offloading transactions to Layer 2 or sidechains, if not already implemented.
Introduce "Know Your Algorithm" KYA as a way to explain security in offloading options in a concise and understandable manner.

##### Phase 6: Convergence#
Multiple developments in scaling, optimization, and offloading are expected to converge, culminating in a comprehensive solution for widespread adoption.
