Find tags on the releases page.\n    # Example for a specific release\ngit checkout v5.0.10 \n\n# Example for a Release Candidate\ngit checkout v6.0.0-RC2 \n\n\n\nHandle SNAPSHOT Dependencies (If Applicable):\nSome development versions, especially Release Candidates, may depend on unreleased SNAPSHOT versions of libraries (like sigmastate-interpreter). If the next step fails due to missing SNAPSHOT dependencies, you must build and publish these dependencies locally first.\nSee the dedicated guide: Handling SNAPSHOT Dependencies\n\n\nCompile the JAR:\nRun the SBT assembly task. This compiles the code and packages the node and all its dependencies into a single executable JAR file.\n    sbt assembly\n\nThe resulting JAR file will be located in the target/scala-*/ directory within the ergo project folder (e.g., target/scala-2.13/ergo-*.jar). The exact name will include the version number.\n\n\nLocate the JAR: Find the generated ergo-*.jar file in the target/scala-*/ directory. You can now move this JAR file to your desired node installation folder (e.g., the ergo folder created in the Manual Setup guide)."
