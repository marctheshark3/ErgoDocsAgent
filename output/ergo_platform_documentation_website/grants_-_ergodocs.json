A Raffle not only provides a clear funding goal, but it also validates the community's support and can be supplemented by additional grant or foundation funding. For projects of a larger scale, multiple grant programs are at your disposal. You can seek funding through the Good Whale Fund or the DarkFund0. These platforms offer you the opportunity to introduce your project to the community, highlighting its potential impact and significance.",
