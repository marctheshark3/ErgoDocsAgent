  "summary": "This page provides solutions to common access issues that users may encounter with their Ergo wallets. It covers scenarios where you have your seed phrase but the restored wallet doesn't contain any ERG or shows a different address, and situations where you do not have your seed phrase. It also provides instructions on deriving additional addresses and best practices for storing your seed securely. A wallet is simply an interface for the blockchain, if you have your seed phrase, simply restore in one of our wallets Ergo node uses a secret root key (derived from seed) for the change address Does the address that's been generated belong to the wallet you've restored? Check the derivation index and derive up to that number in wallet config -> addresses -> derive more Simply select the wallet Navigate to localhost:9053/swagger#/wallet/walletDeriveKey Click \"Try it out\" If you've followed the steps above and managed to recover your funds, please store your seed inline with these best practices below to avoid further issues.",
