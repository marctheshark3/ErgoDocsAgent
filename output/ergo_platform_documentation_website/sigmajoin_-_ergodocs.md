## Summary
Sigmajoin is a privacy protocol designed for use with UTXO-based blockchains, aiming to enhance user anonymity. It builds on the principles of a previous protocol called Zerojoin but introduces features to make it more practical and efficient. The mixing process can be outsourced to a third-party service called a mixer. These mixers can perform the mixing operations in a trustless manner, meaning they cannot steal funds. Sigmajoin allows for transactions that appear to be mixes but are actually withdrawals.

### What is Sigmajoin?#
Sigmajoin is a privacy protocol designed for use with UTXO-based blockchains, aiming to enhance user anonymity. It builds on the principles of a previous protocol called Zerojoin but introduces features to make it more practical and efficient.

Proofs Used
Proofs of knowledge of Diffie-Hellman tuples
Proofs of knowledge of Diffie-Hellman tuples


Interaction Level
Partially Non-interactive: Requires online presence for remixing
Non-interactive


Outsourceability
No, mixing cannot be outsourced
Yes, mixes can be outsourced to third-parties


Types of Boxes
2 (Half-Mix and Full-Mix): Limited to two boxes, constraining scalability and flexibility
More than 2: Offers better scalability and flexibility. Half-mix boxes eliminated as bloat


Stealth Withdraw
Supported
Supported


Fee Handling
Embedded Fee: Includes fees within mix boxes, requiring meticulous calculation
Outsourced Fee: Fees paid by third-party "mixer," simplifying the process and adding flexibility

#### 1. Outsourceability#
The mixing process can be outsourced to a third-party service called a mixer. These mixers can perform the mixing operations in a trustless manner, meaning they cannot steal funds.

#### 2. Stealth Withdraw#
Sigmajoin allows for transactions that appear to be mixes but are actually withdrawals. This makes it even more difficult for an observer to trace transactions, enhancing privacy.

#### 3. Outsourced Fee#
In many privacy protocols, how to pay the mining fee is a challenge. Sigmajoin allows the fee to be paid by the third-party mixers, further simplifying the process for users.

#### Basics#
Mix-box: A special kind of coin (or UTXO) used in Sigmajoin. Each mix-box has two registers a and b which are elements of a mathematical group G.
Alice: The generic term for a participant in the protocol.

#### Core Operations#
Deposit: Users can deposit their coins into a special 'pool' as mix-boxes. These boxes can be in fixed denominations.
Mix: A third-party service or another user can take any two mix-boxes from the pool and mix them. After mixing, two new mix-boxes are added back to the pool. This process conceals the original ownership of the boxes.
Withdraw: Users can withdraw their coins from the pool at any time.

#### Steps for Mixing Boxes#
Select Two Boxes: Choose any two mix-boxes from the pool.
Re-randomise Public Key: Perform a mathematical operation on the registers a and b of each selected mix-box.
Validation: Prove that the mathematical operations were done correctly. The new mix-boxes should look identical to an observer.
