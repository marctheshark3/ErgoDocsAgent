  "summary": "Given the limitations of direct on-chain debugging, external tools and off-chain simulators play a vital role in testing and understanding ErgoScript contract behavior in a controlled environment. Simulators allow you to execute ErgoScript code off-chain, mimicking the on-chain environment to varying degrees. Some Software Development Kits (SDKs) offer interactive environments for experimenting with script snippets and context building. Web-based tools can help with writing scripts and catching syntax errors. The Ergo developer community actively discusses and desires more sophisticated debugging tools, potentially including enhanced simulators with features like breakpoints, step-through execution tracing, and detailed state inspection capabilities.",
