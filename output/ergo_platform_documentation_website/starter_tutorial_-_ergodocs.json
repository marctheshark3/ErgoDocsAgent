      "content": "Ergo Platform uses public key cryptography to ensure that every transaction is secure: every personal wallet has a keypair consisting of a public key and a secret key. The public key is always safe to share \u00e2\u0080\u0094 other people need it to verify that you authorized a transaction. It's like an email address. \nThe secret key, however, is private information that proves you own \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and gives you access to \u00e2\u0080\u0094 your private wallet. It's like a password, and you should never share it with anyone.\nOn Ergo, the secret key is usually a 15 words mnemonic seed phrase that is used to derive the internally used binary master key. From this master key, an infinite number of private and public keys can be derived with an index. So for every mnemonic seed phrase, there are existing multiple key pairs and addresses defined by an index. The main address is always at index 0.\nYou can create this address from a mnemonic phrase the following way:\nJavaKotlinScalaJavaScriptPython\n\n\n    String ergoAddress = Address.createEip3Address(\n      index,\n      NetworkType.MAINNET,\n      SecretString.create(mnemonic),\n      SecretString.empty(),\n      false\n    ).toString()\n\n\n\n    val ergoAddress = Address.createEip3Address(\n      index,\n      NetworkType.MAINNET,\n      SecretString.create(mnemonic),\n      SecretString.empty(),\n      false\n    ).toString()\n\n\n\nval ergoAddress = Address.createEip3Address(\n  index, \n  NetworkType.MAINNET, \n  SecretString.create(mnemonic),\n  SecretString.empty(),\n  false\n).toString\n\n\n\ntbd\n\n\nfrom jpype import java\nfrom ergpy import helper_functions, appkit\n\nergo = appkit.ErgoAppKit(node_url=node_url)\nergo_address = helper_functions.get_wallet_address(ergo=ergo, amount=1, wallet_mnemonic=mnemonic)[0]\n\n# Proper exit()\nhelper_functions.exit()\nHaving the string representation of the address for your mnemonic, you can already receive payments."

Ergo follows Bitcoin's model: A transaction is a set of input boxes and output boxes. The input boxes are spent within a transaction, and output boxes are created. For a transaction to be valid, it must be signed with \nthe private key of the address of the input boxes.\nSo sending payments needs the following steps to be done:\nSearch for unspent boxes covering the amount to be send\nCreate an unsigned transaction with the input boxes found and output boxes for the payment recipient\nSign the transaction\nSubmit the transaction to the network\nLuckily, our SDKs help you by providing high-level methods for this common task.\nJavaJavaScriptPython\n\n\nErgoClient ergoClient = RestApiErgoClient.create(nodeUrl, NetworkType.MAINNET, \"\", RestApiErgoClient.getDefaultExplorerUrl(NetworkType.MAINNET));\n\n//address receiving the tx\nAddress recipient = Address.create(recipientAddress);\n//amount to send\nlong amountToSend = 1000L * 1000L * 1000L // 1 ERG in nanoERGs\nergoClient.execute((BlockchainContext ctx) -> {\n    ErgoProver prover = ctx.newProverBuilder().withMnemonic(\n      SecretString.create(mnemonic),\n      SecretString.empty(),\n      false\n    ).withEip3Secret(0).build()\n\n    String txId = BoxOperations.createForProver(prover, ctx)\n            .withAmountToSpend(amountToSend)\n            .withInputBoxesLoader(new ExplorerAndPoolUnspentBoxesLoader().withAllowChainedTx(true))\n            .send(recipient);\n});\n\n\n\nimport { TransactionBuilder, OutputBuilder } from \"@fleet-sdk/core\";\n\nnew TransactionBuilder(creationHeight);\n\ntype Box = {\n  boxId: string;\n  value: string | bigint;\n  assets: { tokenId: string; amount: string | bigint }[];\n  ergoTree: string;\n  creationHeight: number;\n  additionalRegisters: NonMandatoryRegisters;\n  index: number;\n  transactionId: TransactionId;\n};\n\nnew TransactionBuilder(creationHeight..."
