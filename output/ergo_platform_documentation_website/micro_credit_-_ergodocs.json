While I am avoiding saying anything about \"Satoshi's vision\" (nothing but speculation could be dug up after his exodus), a broad view I witnessed among online forum users in the early years is that a cryptocurrency should provide tools to enrich ordinary people running small businesses providing not much above making ends meet, rather than depersonalized big financial capital. The tools of a cryptocurrency, in the eyes of the original broad community vision, should allow people to conduct economic activity regardless of business size, geographic location, interest rates set by big players, and so on. The tools should allow people to create contracts (not paper contracts, but digital, self-enforcing, and reasonably smart contracts) regardless of differences in jurisdictions, traditions, business practices, etc.",

Thousands of small cooperatives and individual entrepreneurs are more important for healthy and sustainable wealth growth around the globe than a couple of corporations hiding profits in offshore havens.\nAs an example, let's consider a cooperative federation (such as Radical Routes) willing to provide financial help to an entrepreneur thousands of kilometers away (say, in Rojava).\nWe need to assume some details now. First, assume that there are four cooperatives in the network. They collectively lock 10,000 Ergs (in equal parts, so 2,500 Ergs each) in a contract with the following conditions:\nThe cooperatives are associated with public keys pubkeyA, pubkeyB, pubkeyC, pubkeyD. The entrepreneur is associated with a public key businessKey.\nThe cooperatives lock money in a coin prote..."
