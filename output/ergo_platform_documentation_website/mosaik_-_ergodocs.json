      "heading": "On-chain and off-chain code#",
      "content": "Ergo is a smart contract platform for decentralized applications to build on, working with bitcoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s UTXO model. Smart contracts are guard scripts that define when an unspent box can be spent. It is written in ErgoScript, a subset of Scala.\ndApp developers need to build off-chain code as well: the ErgoScript contracts are only verified by miners when an actual transaction is submitted to the Ergo network. The logic to build this transaction has to be implemented and run somewhere else. This off-chain aspect does not contradict the general decentralisation: A perfectly decentralized solution is a downloadable open-source client that can build these transactions and submit them to the network. These clients can be built in any programming language possible. SDKs are now available for JVM languages (ergo-appkit: used in Scala, Java and Kotlin projects) and JS languages (sigma-rust). An example of a downloadable client is ErgoMixer.\nTypically, the off-chain code is run in a centralized manner for user convenience. Users don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to download and set up an application on their local systems, so the off-chain code is hosted on a public server. This concept is used by TokenJay, Ergo Auction House, sigmausd.io, and other services. If the code is open-sourced or smart contracts are well-documented, this is not a problem for decentralization,\nWhile on the one hand, Ergo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off-chain code is very flexible as we can use it with any programming language, with existing SDKs already covering at least four programming languages. On the other hand, this complicates things for aspiring dApp developers: Which programming language should they use?"

    {
      "heading": "UI code#",
      "content": "Another big challenge awaits the developer when that decision is made: A user interface is needed. Many user interface frameworks long to be used, but how should the user interface interact with the off-chain code?\nIn many cases, the decision is made to write everything in JavaScript. Many capable user interface frameworks are available and run on every platform. Often, the UI code and the off-chain code are done within the user's browser. Doing this is legitimate but restricts the dApp's capabilities as we are then limited to the web dapp connector, and ErgoPay users are excluded. Additionally, this can lead to a poor user experience (an example is Ergo auction house that fetches the blockchain state on every website visit from the user's client).\nIt is favorable to separate the off-chain and user interface code but creates another problem for aspiring dApp developers as it introduces the need for an actual client/server architecture and perhaps even different programming languages to be used, not to mention the problem of getting transactions signed by the user, which needs some more knowledge by the dApp developers to interact with wallet applications."

      "heading": "Ergo Mosaik UI system#",
      "content": "Ergo Mosaik UI system is a concept to solve this problem. It is designed to not restrict dApp developers in how they want to implement their dApp. Instead, it enhances the possibilities for experienced dApp developers while taking aspiring dApp developers at hand and providing a solution for working with off-chain code and user interfaces, supporting all types of wallets and platforms in the future.\nAt its core, Mosaik is a JSON-based markup language served via a REST API intended to be used by Ergo platform dApps. Therefore, it provides elements and interactions typically needed for these.\nMosaik elements can't be skinned and adapted in their appearance by the dApp - the actual appearance is defined by the Mosaik executor application, which in many cases will be a user's wallet application. To gain interactivity, the language defines not only view elements but also actions. Mosaik's strength is that the view elements and actions provided target typical use cases of blockchain dapps: for example, it provides an ErgoAmountInputField that lets the user input an Ergo Amount - if wanted, even showing a fiat comparison value - and gives the dApp the nanoerg amount without any rounding issues.\nWhile the core is JSON-based, so that Mosaik libraries can easily be written in any preferred programming language, the Mosaik reference implementation also contains an easy-to-use domain-specific language for Kotlin, making writing Mosaik views very easy and convenient. The hands-on examples show how to set up a Mosaik app served by the Spring Boot framework, which can be used for off-chain code, automatic jobs and REST APIs.\nAt the time of this writing, two Mosaik executors are available: A desktop application meant for testing and debugging Mosaik apps and the Ergo Wallet App for Android (experimental feature branch). Integration for iOS wallet app, desktop and browser extension wallets is planned.\nWhile now it is still too early to build a dApp solely on Mosaik, we recommend tak..."

      "content": "Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a real look at Mosaik to get a feeling for the system. Clone the repository from https://github.com/MrStahlfelge/mosaik to your local system. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need Java 11 or newer installed for the next steps. Start the Mosaik Desktop Executor (which also serves as a debugging tool) by invoking the following command.\n./gradlew desktop-demo:run (or gradlew desktop-demo:run on Windows). Once downloading the necessary dependencies and compiling is done, you will be presented with the following window:\nThe column on the right gives you info on the input values that the current view holds, as well as the JSON model that is currently shown. Most space is reserved for the actual Mosaik app that is running. The debugger shows a simple built-in app demonstrating a few view elements and actions. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a closer look at the JSON on the right-hand side. If you copy it in a better-suited editor, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that its outermost object contains two properties:\n{\n      \"actions\": [...],\n      \"view\": {\n        \"type\": \"Column\",\n        \"children\": [...]\n      }\n    }\nThe Mosaik app consists of actions and view elements. Here, the root view element is a column. One of the child view elements is the label that shows the text \u00e2\u0080\u009cLabel (alignment end, click it)\n{\n     \"id\": \"clickLabel\",\n     \"type\": \"Label\",\n     \"text\": \"Label (alignment end, click it)\",\n     \"align\": \"END\",\n     \"style\": \"BODY1BOLD\",\n     \"onClick\": \"replaceLabel\"\n    }\nIf you click this label in the desktop application, you will see that the view changes:\nThis was caused by the onClick attribute defined on the JSON above. It references \u00e2\u0080\u009creplaceLabel\u00e2\u0080\u009d. When you look at the list of defined actions, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find this action declared as follows:\n{\n     \"type\": \"ChangeSiteAction\",\n     \"id\": \"replaceLabel\",\n     \"newContent\": {\n       \"view\": {\n         \"id\": \"clickLabel\",\n         \"type\": \"Label\",\n         \"text\": \"Label (alignment end, already clicked)\",\n         \"align\": \"END\",\n         \"style\": \"BOD..."
