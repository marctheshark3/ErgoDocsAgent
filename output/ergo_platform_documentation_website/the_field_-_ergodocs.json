The project is designed to be DAO-driven and open-source.\nThe Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Smart Contracts are complete, with no adjustments required this week. No further adjustments are needed for the guard bots.\nIntegration of the dApp front-end UI for the MVP is ongoing - it is currently functional, but minor tweaks and improvements are expected soon.\nPrivate testing of pools and pledges is currently underway.\nThe guard group has successfully posted a test Market to receive pledges.\nPledging to the market has been successful (see below).\nOnce the Market closes and the guards post the results, testing of \"pledge winnings and calculations\" will occur.\nThere is an ambitious goal to have an Olympic event next week for Live Beta testing from the community using small amounts (see below).\nJoin the project's Discord server at https://discord.gg/wa38bX57tY to learn more and/or volunteer to help move the project and DAO forward."
