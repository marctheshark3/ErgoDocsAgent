Liquid vs Illiquid Funds
The Ergo Foundation's treasury consists of both liquid and illiquid assets, providing a diverse portfolio to support the growth and development of the Ergo ecosystem. The liquid assets, such as ERG and BTC, can be readily utilized for various purposes, while the illiquid assets, like Gluon, SPF, and RSN tokens, are held strategically to avoid exerting downward pressure on these early-stage projects.
As these projects mature and their tokens become more liquid, the Ergo Foundation will have the opportunity to leverage these assets to further augment its expenditure capabilities and support the Ergo ecosystem more effectively.

### Wallets#
You can find the Ergo Foundation treasury and current balance on-chain at the following locations:

### Historic Spending#
The Ergo Foundation has spent the majority of the Treasury for the benefit of the protocol and community. Funds were even spent when the ERG price was low, as it was necessary to bootstrap the thriving community Ergo now boasts.
