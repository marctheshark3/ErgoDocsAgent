      "content": "Storage Fee Duration: The box must have been retained for at least the designated storage fee period. This is validated by calculating the difference between the height of the upcoming block, as indicated in the preheader, and the creation height of the box. This difference should be greater than or equal to the storage fee period.\nSpending Proof: For an expired box, the spending proof must be left empty, eliminating the need for cryptographic authorization for the box's spending.\nStorage Rent Awareness: If the expired box is affected by storage rent, it must be processed through the appropriate storage rent mechanism. The storage rent endpoint must be queried to ensure compliance with Ergo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s storage rent rules."

      "content": "Querying Storage Rent Endpoint\nExpired boxes should be validated against the dedicated storage rent endpoint before spending.\n\nThis ensures that the expired box has fulfilled the required storage rent conditions before it is spent.\n\n\nIntegration with Mining Pools\n\nMining pools using Miningcore can now query storage rent block candidates through MiningRequestSRBlockCandidateAsync() using this fork\n\nThis ensures that block templates correctly account for expired boxes under storage rent rules.\n\n\nImplementation in ErgoClient\n\nThe ErgoClient class has been updated to include a SrUrl field, allowing seamless communication with the storage rent service.\n\nThe MiningRequestSRBlockCandidateAsync() method fetches block templates that consider storage rent rules, ensuring compliance with Ergo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state management policies.\n\n\nSpending an Expired Box Affected by Storage Rent\n\nIf an expired box lacks sufficient ERG to pay the required storage rent fee, a new valid box must be referenced in the transaction.\nThis new box should either contain sufficient funds to cover storage rent or comply with mining pool policies for processing expired boxes.\nThe storage rent logic ensures that old, unused boxes do not persist indefinitely in the blockchain state."

The mining pool and Ergo client implementations ensure that expired boxes are properly accounted for in block templates, maintaining blockchain sustainability and efficiency."
