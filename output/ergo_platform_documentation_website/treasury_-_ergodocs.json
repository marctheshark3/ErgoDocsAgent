A significant portion of this Treasury has been expended for the benefit of the Ergo protocol and community. Even during periods of low ERG price, the Foundation continued to invest in order to foster and grow the Ergo ecosystem. For more information on Ergo's emission schedule, tokenomics and allocation, visit the emission section. Additionally, the Treasury exchanged 1,782,615 ERG for EFYT, a token issued on the Waves Platform in 2017 to build an early community through airdrops and raise funds before the Ergo mainnet launch.",
