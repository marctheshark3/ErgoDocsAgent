For a visual overview, see the emission schedule on ergo.watch.\nSustaining Ergo Mining: Revenue Streams Beyond Emissions\nAs Ergo's emission schedule is set to conclude around the year 2045, questions naturally arise about the mechanisms that will incentivize miners to continue securing the network. Fortunately, Ergo's architecture includes support for a variety of revenue streams designed to promote both network growth and long-term sustainability. See this page for more information."
