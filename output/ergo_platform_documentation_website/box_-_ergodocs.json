      "content": "(Back to: Data Model Overview)\nErgo uses a transactional model similar to Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model. In this model, transactions create and consume single-use entities called 'boxes'.\nIn ErgoScript, a 'box' is a versatile version of a UTXO. It represents not only the amount of cryptocurrency owned by an address, but also contains 'registers' for additional data. This data can range from simple values to complex structures, which can be used in transactions and smart contract execution.\nThis makes Ergo's box different from a traditional UTXO, which only represents an amount of unspent cryptocurrency associated with a certain address. In UTXO-based cryptocurrencies, each transaction consumes one or more UTXOs as inputs and creates one or more UTXOs as outputs, with the 'unspent' outputs being the 'coins' that can be spent in future transactions.\nThe term 'box' in Ergo's context captures the idea that these entities are like containers holding various types of information (value, tokens, custom data, etc.), beyond just the unspent transaction output balance. This makes the boxes in Ergo significantly more flexible and functional, enabling more complex operations, such as running scripts or smart contracts, directly on the blockchain."

      "content": "A box is an immutable unit, which can be created or removed, but never altered.\nThe box is not just a simple coin; it houses data, code, and registers, with all of its contents exclusively stored in the registers.\nFour pre-defined registers contain the box's monetary value, its protection script (the ErgoTree), and the ID of the transaction that created the box.\nEach box has a unique ID, derived from the unique contents of the box, including the data of the transaction that created it.\nBoxes are integral to the Ergo protocol. The active box set (UTXO set) is authenticated through a hash-based data structure, facilitating the development of lightweight full nodes, as detailed in this paper.\nA box can hold up to six additional registers (R4-R9) with typed data, accessible by the script.\nTransactions consist of both input and output boxes."

      "content": "Besides the registers, each box features a unique identification hash that can be referenced using the id function in ErgoScript. Box ids are computed by applying the blake2b256 hash function to the box's content, expressed as a Coll[Byte]. You can directly access the un-hashed byte collection representing a box using the bytes function. Note that each box\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content and id are cryptographically unique, meaning that no two boxes within the blockchain can share the same id or content bytes. This uniqueness is guaranteed by the inclusion of creationInfo (R3 register) in each box, as transaction ids and associated output indexes must be unique to a given UTXO. The bytesWithoutRef function can be used to retrieve a Coll[Byte] that excludes such information."
