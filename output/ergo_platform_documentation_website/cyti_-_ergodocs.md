## Summary
CYTI is the acronym for Choose Your Token ID. The team built a âminableâ smart contract that will allow an entity âto mint tokens with a given character sequence at the beginning of the token ID. A token minter creates a CYTI request, and miners generate the proper token ID using the CYTI miner software. When one of the miners succeeds, [they receive] the fee from the CYTI contract and the token with the right token ID is sent to the token minter.â
