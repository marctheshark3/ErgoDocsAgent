In this configuration, the capacity is set to 5000 messages. Once this limit is reached, the mailbox refuses to accept more messages until space becomes available.\nThe bounded-mailbox configuration helps control the load on your actor system by limiting the number of unprocessed messages an actor can receive, preventing it from becoming overwhelmed. It is a vital configuration for ensuring the resilience and stability of your system."
