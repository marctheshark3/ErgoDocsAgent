  "summary": "Ergo's powerful capabilities enable the creation of innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives, including derivatives and options trading protocols. These protocols offer traders alternative platforms for speculating on asset prices, managing risk, and generating yield in a trustless and decentralized manner. Hodlcoin is a high-risk, high-reward game that encourages players to \"HODL\" their ERGs. Players can deposit their ERGs into a common reserve (HODLing) or withdraw ERGs from the reserve by burning their HODL ERGs (un-HODLing). Un-HODLing incurs a penalty fee (e.g., 3% or 10%) that is added to the common reserve, creating an incentive for players to hold their ERGs for longer periods.",

It is a smart contract that periodically issues new tokens and sells them via call options, with the exercise price determined by the current market price on a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Spectrum.
