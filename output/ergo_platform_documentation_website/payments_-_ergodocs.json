ErgoPay can connect any wallet with any dApp, while a web dApp connector is limited to web extension wallets and website dApps. It can only connect processes living in the same web browser. As a dApp developer, you may not know which type of wallet application will connect to your dApp. Therefore, a part of your logic must run on a server that can be accessed by user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wallet applications.",
