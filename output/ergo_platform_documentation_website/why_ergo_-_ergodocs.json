    {
      "heading": "A Fair Start#",
      "content": "Ergo was dedicated to ensuring a fair and equitable launch, reflecting Bitcoin's foundational principles to prevent undue influence from large-scale investors. This strategy democratized access and established a sustainable economic model for the network's growth.\nThe mining protocol allocated a portion of the rewards to a treasury, managed by the non-profit Ergo Foundation, to support ongoing development and adoption. In its first 2.5 years, the Foundation accumulated 4,330,791.5 ERGs (4.43% of the total supply). For more information, visit the Ergo Foundation and emission sections.\nFixed Supply: Ergo has a fixed supply of 97,739,924 coins, combating inflation.\nExtended Emission Schedule: Through EIP-27, Ergo's mining rewards are extended for approximately 17.38 years, enhancing sustainability and making $ERG more scarce and valuable over time."

      "content": "Ergo addresses several key challenges inherent to Bitcoin, enhancing functionality, security, scalability, and privacy:\nChallenges Faced by Bitcoin\nErgo's Solution\n\n\n\n\nLimited smart contract functionality\nRich language (ErgoScript), eUTXO model, Sigma protocols, transaction chaining\n\n\nUnclear network security as block reward subsidy approaches zero and transaction fees remain low and volatile\nMore revenue from transaction fees due to DeFi and higher usage/scalability, storage rent, mining by subpools\n\n\nLack of economy around state leading to miners receiving no compensation for holding UTXO set\nStorage Rent provides additional rewards for miners, compensating for long-term UTXO holding\n\n\nInefficient merkle tree data structure leading to inefficient light clients\nAVL trees enabling drastically more efficient light client verification\n\n\nWeak and cumbersome optional privacy tools\nSigma protocols enable true peer-to-peer privacy, ErgoMixer provides better anonymity than Monero\n\n\nMassive scaling challenges\nDecentralized on-chain governance, NiPoPoWs enable light clients with full node security, more Layer-2 options"

    {
      "heading": "How Does Ergo Address Ethereum's Challenges?#",
      "content": "Ergo's UTXO-based programming model is declarative, specifying conditions for a transaction to be accepted (not changes to storage state). This contrasts with Ethereum's imperative Account model.\nChallenges Faced by Ethereum\nErgo's Solution\n\n\n\n\nCreating transactions and utilizing smart contracts requires paying fees in ETH\nBabel Fees allow users to pay transaction fees in native tokens\n\n\nGas requirement and the 'stopping problem'\nNo gas fees or stopping problem, most computations done off-chain, cost-predictable on-chain verification\n\n\nHigh gas fees and network congestion\nEngineered with long-term scaling in mind, using advanced and well-researched tools\n\n\nNode centralization in AWS / Infura\nAnyone can run a node (similar to Bitcoin), mitigants prevent bad node running experience\n\n\nCensorship: Most blocks are OFAC blocks\nDecentralization and PoW deeply ingrained in Ergo's ethos, resists censorship\n\n\nCentralization of Monetary Policy with Vitalik and Ethereum Foundation able to change emission\nAll ERGs created in genesis block, released per pre-set emission schedule, changes require supermajority\n\n\nPoor security and frequent hacks costing billions\nUTXO model and efficient onchain verification with most computation done off-chain\n\n\nPoor privacy tools due to Account ledger model\nCombination of eUTXO model and sigma protocols achieves optional privacy superior to Monero\nView Comparisons with other projects."
