### How to Use the APIs (For Beginners)#
If you are new to using APIs and want to get started with Ergo's APIs, here are some steps to help you get going:
Choose an API: Determine which Ergo API suits your needs. Consider the specific functionalities and data you require for your application or project.


Read the Documentation: Visit the API documentation for the chosen API. The documentation provides detailed information on the available endpoints, parameters, and response formats. Familiarize yourself with the API's capabilities and explore any example calls provided.


Understand the Endpoints: Review the list of available endpoints and their purposes. Each endpoint serves a specific function and allows you to retrieve or interact with different data or services.


Authenticate (If Required): Some APIs may require authentication to access certain endpoints or perform specific actions. Refer to the API documentation to understand the authentication mechanisms and requirements. Obtain any necessary credentials or tokens to authenticate your requests.


Test Endpoints: Use an API testing tool like Postman or cURL to send requests to the API endpoints. Start with simple requests to retrieve basic data, such as blockchain information or transaction details. Verify that you receive the expected responses.


Explore Data Retrieval: Experiment with different endpoints to retrieve the data you need. For example, if you want to retrieve address-specific data, use the appropriate endpoint and provide the required parameters, such as the address. Study the response structure and extract the relevant information for your application.


Integrate into Your Application: Once you are comfortable with retrieving data, integrate the API calls into your application or project. Use the retrieved data to power your application's features or display blockchain information to users.


Handle Errors: Be prepared to handle potential errors or exceptions that may occur during API interactions. Refer to the API documentation to ...
