  "summary": "Author: aslesarenko\nStatus: Proposed\nCreated: 06-Apr-2020\nLicense: CC0\nForking: Not Needed EIP-0005 outlines a standard for serializing contract templates and including metadata to make them reusable across multiple platforms. It aims to provide a way for developers to easily move contract templates between different protocol implementations, applications, and tools. Ergo employs a robust language, known as ErgoTree, to create guarding propositions that protect UTXO boxes. While ErgoTree's serialization is efficient for storage and transaction validation, it lacks the metadata necessary for broader application use. This EIP aims to extend ErgoTree's capabilities by adding serialization formats for contract templates, including metadata for more versatile applications.",
