These protocols allow a prover to convince a verifier that they know a value, such as a secret key, without revealing the value itself (a property related to zero-knowledge proofs). \u00ce\u00a3-protocols are the foundation for many privacy-preserving and multi-signature functionalities in Ergo.\nIn ErgoScript, proving and verifying cryptographic statements are first-class primitives, giving developers access to powerful \u00ce\u00a3-protocols. Scripts protecting transaction outputs can contain \u00ce\u00a3-statements, which must be proven (by generating \u00ce\u00a3-proofs) before the outputs can be spent.\nConceptually, \u00ce\u00a3-proofs are generalizations of digital signatures. The Schnorr signature scheme is the canonical example of a \u00ce\u00a3-proof: it allows the recipient to prove knowledge of a secret (discrete logarithm) without revealing it. \u00ce\u00a3-proofs in Ergo extend this concept, allowing the creation of more complex cryptographic protocols like multi-signature, ring signatures, and threshold signatures."

Essentially, this is the Schnorr signature scheme.\nProof of Equality of Discrete Logarithms (Diffie-Hellman Tuple): This protocol proves that two values share the same discrete logarithm across two different generators.\nThese basic protocols can be composed to create more advanced proofs using logical connectives like AND, OR, and THRESHOLD. This composability is what enables the creation of sophisticated smart contracts and multi-signature schemes.\nFor a detailed introduction to \u00ce\u00a3-protocols, refer to the paper On \u00ce\u00a3-protocols."

      "content": "A powerful feature of \u00ce\u00a3-protocols in Ergo is their composability. You can create logical combinations of cryptographic statements using basic AND/OR logic.\nExamples include:\nRing Signatures: A ring signature is a proof of knowledge of one of multiple secrets. For example:\n\nProve knowledge of either secret A or secret B.\n\n\n\nThreshold Signatures: A threshold signature is a proof that a certain number of secrets are known. For example:\n\nProve knowledge of at least two of three secrets.\nThese constructions allow for flexible and privacy-preserving proofs. The THRESHOLD construct (also known as k-out-of-n) is particularly useful for multi-party agreements, ensuring that a subset of participants can authorize a transaction without requiring everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involvement."

      "content": "Ring signatures provide privacy by allowing a user to sign a transaction on behalf of a group without revealing which group member signed it. This is particularly useful for creating anonymous transactions and decentralized mixers, such as ErgoMixer. The privacy of ring signatures makes them ideal for applications where anonymity is crucial, such as anonymous donations or private payments."

      "content": "\u00ce\u00a3-protocols can be combined with time-locked conditions.

The SigmaBoolean is then converted into a cryptographic proof using the Fiat-Shamir transformation, ensuring that the transaction can only be authorized by parties who possess the necessary secrets (such as private keys).\n\n\n\nVerifier:\n\nThe Verifier also uses the ErgoTree interpreter to reduce the spending condition into a SigmaBoolean. It then checks the cryptographic proof against this proposition, ensuring that the transaction is valid and all required conditions are met."

      "content": "The Fiat-Shamir transformation is a cryptographic technique that makes interactive proof systems non-interactive, suitable for use in blockchain environments. This is crucial for Sigma protocols, as it allows \u00ce\u00a3-proofs to be created and verified without requiring real-time interaction between the prover and the verifier.\nIn Ergo, \u00ce\u00a3-protocols rely on the Fiat-Shamir transformation to generate challenges (hash values) from the commitments and messages involved in the proof. This ensures that the proofs are non-interactive and can be verified deterministically on-chain."
