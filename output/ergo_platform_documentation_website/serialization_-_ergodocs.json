This saves space when, for example, a collection of items is serialized. This is done so that a type tree can fully describe the contents of a typed data structure.\nFor example, having a typed data object d: (Int, Coll[Byte], Boolean), we can tell, by examining the structure of the type, that d is a tuple with three items; the first item contains a 32-bit integer, the second a collection of bytes, and the third a logical true/false value.\nTo serialize/deserialize typed data, we need to know its type descriptor (type tree). The data serialization procedure is recursive over the type tree and the corresponding sub-components of the data object. For primitive types (the leaves of the type tree), the format is fixed. The data values of ErgoTree types are serialized according to the predefined recursive function shown in Figure 5, which uses the notation from Table 3.\nFigure 5: Data serialization format"

The interpretation of the byte array depends on the first header byte(s), which use VLQ encoding (up to 30 bits are reserved). We currently define meaning only for the first byte, which may be extended in future versions. The meaning of the bits is shown in Figure 12.\nFigure 12: ErgoTree header bits\nCurrently, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t specify interpretation for the second and other bytes of the header. We reserve the possibility to extend the header by using Bit 7 == 1 and chaining additional bytes as in VLQ.\nOnce new bytes are required, a new language version should be created and implemented via soft-forkability. That new language will give an interpretation for the new bytes.\nThe default behavior of ErgoTreeSerializer is to preserve the original structure of ErgoTree and check consistency. In case of any inconsistency, the serializer throws an exception.\nIf the constant segregation bit (Bit 4) is set to 1, then the constants collection contains the constants for which there may be ConstantPlaceholder nodes in the tree. However, if the constant segregation bit is 0, then the constants collection should be empty, and any placeholder in the tree will lead to an exception."
