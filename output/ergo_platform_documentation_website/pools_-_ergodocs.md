## Summary
Mining pools are groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of finding a block. The reward is then split among the pool members, proportional to the amount of work they contributed. Distribute your hashrate! Keep Ergo decentralised! Please distribute your hashrate and mine towards smaller pools!

## Mining Pools#
Mining pools are groups of miners who combine their computational resources to increase their chances of finding a block. The reward is then split among the pool members, proportional to the amount of work they contributed.
Distribute your hashrate! Keep Ergo decentralised!
Please distribute your hashrate and mine towards smaller pools! A comprehensive list of Ergo mining pools is available on Mining Pool Stats.

### Earnings and Pool Size#
While larger pools win blocks more frequently and can provide more consistent payouts, your long-term earnings should be roughly the same regardless of the pool size. In smaller pools, you might not receive a payout until the pool wins a block.

### Dual Mining#
Dual mining allows you to mine Ergo alongside other coins such as KAS and ALPH. Mining Pool Stats provides details on pools currently offering this feature natively.

### Solo Mining#
Solo mining is an option for those who wish to operate independently of mining pools. This requires setting up a node and stratum server, which can be done by following the instructions provided in our guide.
Several mining pools offer a solo port for those who prefer this method. A comprehensive list of these pools can be found on Mining Pool Stats.

### Resources#
Nice Hash is a popular platform for cryptocurrency mining and trading that supports Ergo. They hosted a live event with Ergo, which you can watch here.
