The team's strength is further enhanced by the support of several advisors.\nRosen Bridge operates entirely on self-funding, with no involvement of private sales, venture capital, or SAFT agreements. All contracts are financed out of pocket as there is no emission yet. The core team is made up of 6 main developers.\nInitial liquidity for Ergo, accounting for 5%, was deposited on the Spectrum LP. This process was carried out without the involvement of bots or front-running. (Refer to the Tokenomics section for more details)\nA collaboration was established with Zengate for Catalyst, as it involves Cardano politics, an area that falls within their realm of expertise.\nThe team has successfully completed and received funds from milestone 3 and has submitted milestone 4 for F10 funding."

      "heading": "History#",
      "content": "The Rosen Bridge team was initially assembled during ERGOHACK I. Under the mentorship of @mhs_sam, team members @RaaCT0R, @vorujack, and @zargarzadeh developed ErgoRaffle. This marked the beginning of their significant contributions to the ecosystem, which include projects like minotaur-wallet and ergo-faucet. The concept of a bridge has been a consistent focus for the team since 2021, initially with ErgoGravity, an Ergo connector to the Wormhole bridge. However, after the Wormhole bridge was compromised, resulting in a loss of $325m, the team shifted their focus towards developing a bridge centered around Ergo."
