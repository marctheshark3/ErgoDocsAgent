SigmaUSD supports a fully decentralized stablecoin emission setup, offering a stable, simple, and decentralized stablecoin.

SigmaUSD users also submit ERGs to the dApp reserves to mint SigmaUSD, provided there are sufficient reserves within the dApp. Users can redeem their SigmaUSD for an equivalent amount of ERGs from the reserves at the current exchange rate as provided by the ERG-USD oracle pool.\nReserve Providers can redeem their reserve coins for ERGs if the price of ERGs increases or a significant amount of protocol fees are collected, covering the value of all existing minted SigmaUSD plus an extra margin. This allows Reserve Providers to profit by receiving more underlying reserve cryptocurrency than when they minted their reserve coins."

      "content": "What is a stablecoin?\n\nIt is a derivate product. This derivative intends to create a way to stabilise volatility.\n\nPrice stability is a critical part of finance; without it, it becomes difficult to create long-term financial product modellings. Investment takes a risk; a good business requires modelling and forecasting to estimate profitability, whether on-chain or off. \nThe crypto space, by nature, is highly volatile. SigmaUSD and SigmaRSV are mechanisms to create stable value, and stable value is the foundation for a prosperous economy. \nDerivatives were created to minimise volatility when trading in foreign currencies. \nIn a globalised economy, the shift in purchasing power of one currency vs another can be a highly destructive force. Instability disrupts trade and destroys business models. \nStability comes at a cost. Instability in price is often added as a premium, sometimes a price premium, and other times an interest premium. \nThe cost of SigmaUSD is the current USD value of ERG plus a 2.5% fee. \nThis is a low premium, 2.5%. \nWhat is your current interest rate? What is the rate at which a bank will collateralise an asset you hold and offer a loan?\nVery few have access to this low premium in the global economy, and the bank may not offer liquidity with little to no reserve.\nSigmaUSD allows anyone who owns ERG to collateralise their ERG and create liquid value. What does this mean?\nThe long-term goal will be to create use cases for this stablecoin that offers a return beyond this 2.5% fee.\nWhy SigmaUSD\n\nWhen Dapps and use/utility are in place that supersedes this 2.5% fee, magic happens. \n\nA user can take their ERG, create SigmaUSD, and then use that to create a return greater than the 2.5% cost of stability. Most business models rely on stability and price/risk prediction rather than asset speculation. \nSigmaUSD is not just an opportunity to take a short position on ERG. Rather it is a way to use your reserve value to generate yield. Defi on Ergo delivers addi..."
