## Summary
The ergo-utilities-rust repository contains a collection of experimental libraries designed for writing off-chain Ergo code in Rust. These utilities provide a robust and efficient way to interact with the Ergo blockchain, enabling developers to build powerful and secure applications. The utilities are built with a focus on performance, security, and ease of use. They offer a wide range of features, including transaction building, signing, and serialization, as well as various cryptographic functions. For more information on working in Rust, see the Sigma Rust documentation.
