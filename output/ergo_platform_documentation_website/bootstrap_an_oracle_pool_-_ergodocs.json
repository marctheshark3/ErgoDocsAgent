We want to keep consensus above \u00bd, so it means we can start a pool of 9 oracles (oracle_tokens:quantity: 9, ballot_tokens:quantity: 9), with 5 oracles threshold for minimum data points (min_data_points: 5) and voting (min_votes: 5). This way, we'll have 3 vacant oracles places in case someone wants to join later.
