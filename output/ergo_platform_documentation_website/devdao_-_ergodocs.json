      "heading": "Scope#",
      "content": "The scope of the DevDAO includes:\nResearch: Blockchain (PoW and PoW-based protocols, privacy-enhancing protocols, sidechains, optimistic and ZK verification of off-chain computations), and monetary (alternative monetary systems on the blockchain, stablecoins, mechanism design in tokenomics)\nCore development: Reference client implemented in Scala repositories (debox, scorex-util, scrypto, sigmastate-interpreter, ergo), and parts of the protocol implemented in Rust (sigma-rust)\nInfrastructure: Libraries and open-source wallets (AppKit, Fleet, Nautilus, ergo-wallet)\nOracle pool framework\nChainCash (as an assembler level for monetary innovations, such as local exchange trading systems)"

    {
      "heading": "Vision#",
      "content": "The DevDAO envisions Ergo as Digital Gold 2.0, a mineable digital commodity with trustless derivatives and expressive contracts. By building upon Ergo's robust DeFi ecosystem and introducing sidechains, the DevDAO aims to expand the decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply, creating a more inclusive and accessible financial system for the Ergo community and beyond."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Completed Milestones#",
      "content": "The Ergo platform, with the support of the Ergo Foundation and community developers, has already made significant strides in developing its infrastructure and DeFi ecosystem. This includes launching basic infrastructure such as wallets and explorers, as well as a wide range of DeFi tools and trustless derivatives, such as:\nSigmaUSD stablecoin (Djed protocol)\nSpectrum DEX (AMM-based)\nErgoMixer (non-interactive, non-custodial mixer)\nErgoAuctionHouse (peer-to-peer auctions)\nSigmaFi (peer-to-peer loans via bonds)\nDuckpools (lending pools)\nErgoRaffle (decentralized crowdfunding)\nEXLE (uncollateralized lending)\nSigmaO (trustless options)\nHodlCoin (trustless ERG derivative with non-declining price)\nAuctionCoin (emission via auctions)\nOracle Pools (federated transparent data providing)\nRosen Bridge (two-layered federated bridge)\nThese tools collectively contribute to the creation of more trustless collateral through various means such as AuctionCoin, OptionCoin, and fair initial mining offerings. As a result, Ergo's decentralized monetary base and derivative money supply continue to grow. It's worth noting that the entire DeFi ecosystem on Ergo is built upon its unique ErgoTree/ErgoScript contractual layer, also known as Sigma, which provides a secure and flexible foundation for the development of complex financial applications."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Upcoming Milestones#",
      "content": "Looking ahead, key milestones include:\nThe launch of new DeFi tools such as Paideia, Dexy/Gluon stablecoins, ChainCash, Analog Ergo, and OptionCoin\nImplementing sidechains with trustless transfers and various consensus mechanisms (merged mined with ERG, other blockchains, or double merged mined)\nExpanding Ergo's contractual layer to sidechains, incorporating features like Bulletproofs-based sigma protocols and elevating certain contracts to first-class citizens\nExperimenting with scalability solutions like sharding on sidechains\nUtilizing ERG and other tokens on Ergo and sidechains from launch, fostering a rich and diverse DeFi ecosystem\nLaunching existing applications on sidechains, contingent on modifications to the contractual layer\nBy achieving these milestones, the DevDAO aims to establish Ergo and its Sigma layer as a central hub for UTXO PoW blockchains with powerful smart contract capabilities."

    {
      "heading": "Monetization Strategies#",
      "content": "To ensure the sustainability and growth of the Ergo ecosystem, the DevDAO is exploring various monetization strategies, such as:\nReceiving a percentage of sidechain token emissions, similar to the Ergo Treasury contract\nOffering consultancy services and support for launching applications on sigma chains\nThese strategies will help fund ongoing development and foster a thriving community of developers and users around the Ergo platform, in collaboration with the Ergo Foundation and the wider Ergo community."

      "heading": "Goals#",
      "content": "Organize discussions on research topics, EIPs, and workshops\nFind funding for bounties and salaries\nMaintain existing infrastructure, improve existing protocol-related code and libraries, and explorers\nBring thousands of new developers into Ergo dApp development by creating and promoting tutorials and dApp examples\nSupport the needs of dApps and wallets\nHelp with auditing and testing dApps"
