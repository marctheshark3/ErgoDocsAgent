      "content": "Wallets are stored in the local storage of the SAFEW browser extension. The mnemonic is encrypted with AES-256 using the spending password, which is not stored in the application. The password is required for spending funds or managing addresses. ErgoPay wallets allow for remote transaction signing using iOS or Android wallet v1.6+, avoiding the need to store the encrypted mnemonic in the browser extension's local storage."

The explorer and node used for interacting with the Ergo blockchain are configurable. ErgoPay/ReadOnly wallets enhance privacy by keeping wallet contents hidden. ErgoMixer integration facilitates the use of privacy tools."
