However, you will need to send the Token ID to @Glasgow if you want it bridged to existing Ergo chats. The bot only needs permission to see/read messages and set webhooks in the channel you want to bridge.\n2. Invite ErgoBridgeBot to your Telegram.\nIf Shieldy is enabled, you'll need to use /allowInvitingBots.\n3. Notify @Glasgow about the channel/server you want to bridge so it can be added to the configuration."

      "content": "Discord does not currently allow bots to reply to messages when spoofing someone. \n\nAllow webhooks to use reply messages#3282\n\n\n\nThe Telegram API does not report deleted messages. \n\nThis means any spam deleted on Telegram will remain visible on Discord.  \nWorkaround: Restrict new Telegram users from speaking until they verify their identity. OrgRobot is a useful tool for this, with a set of custom entry questions. This should stop most bots. (However, some spammers are real people and cannot be prevented.)\nDespite these limitations, the bridge works quite well.\nIf set, names/profile-photos will be spoofed if they are similar on both platforms. (Names can also be manually mapped). However, profile photos need to be re-cached when a new bridge is added. \nResponses will reply to the message on Telegram platforms, triggering notifications. On Discord, the message will be quoted."
