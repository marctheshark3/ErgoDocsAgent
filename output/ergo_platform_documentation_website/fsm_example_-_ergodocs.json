  "summary": "Finite State Machines (FSMs) are a computational model used to design systems that can be in one of a finite number of states at any given time. The machine transitions from one state to another based on specific inputs or conditions. This model is particularly valuable for implementing multi-stage protocols or contracts on the blockchain, where the allowed actions depend on the current state of the contract. In the context of Ergo's eUTXO model, an FSM contract is implemented as a sequence of transactions, where each transaction consumes a box representing the current state and creates a new box representing the next state.

Other registers hold data associated with that state.\nTransitions: The ErgoScript guarding the state box defines the valid transitions. It checks:\nThe conditions required to move from the current state (e.g., specific inputs provided, signatures, blockchain height).\nThat the output box correctly represents the next valid state (e.g., the state identifier in R4 is updated correctly, other registers are preserved or updated according to protocol rules).\n\n\nImmutability: Each transaction creates a new box for the next state, preserving the immutable nature of the blockchain. The previous state box is consumed (spent)."

This approach allows for more complex state transitions while maintaining efficiency.\nAs described in the \"Advanced ErgoScript Tutorial,\" we can emulate long-lived contracts by creating new boxes with the same script. While the box ID will change, the contract logic persists across state transitions.\nImplementing robust FSMs requires careful planning of states, transitions, and the data that needs to be preserved or updated in registers at each step."
