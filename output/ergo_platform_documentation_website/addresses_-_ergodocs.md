## Content
## Addresses#
Addresses in Ergo are short strings that correspond to specific scripts and serve as a means to protect a box.
Unlike Bitcoin (BTC), where addresses store a single amount, in Ergo's eUTxO model, a box contains registers that can store various values, including its native tokens.
So, each box has an ERG amount and may or may not have a bunch of {tokenid, token amount} pairs, all in the UTXO model.
Unlike account-based models like eth, ergo tokens are native and are not smart contracts.
