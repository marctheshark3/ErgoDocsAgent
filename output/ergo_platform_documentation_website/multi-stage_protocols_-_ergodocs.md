## Summary
Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are known for their scalability and reduced error rates. However, Ethereum's account model offers the advantages of persistent storage and a shared global context. Multi-Stage Contracts utilize a technique involving transaction trees to mimic persistent storage in UTXO-based systems. This is achieved by interlinking multiple UTXOs, each containing snippets of code, to create extensive multi-stage protocols. This approach introduces on-chain computations and enables the execution of parallel actions within smart contracts.

## Multi-Stage Protocols#
Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are known for their scalability and reduced error rates. However, Ethereum's account model offers the advantages of persistent storage and a shared global context. Multi-Stage Contracts utilize a technique involving transaction trees to mimic persistent storage in UTXO-based systems. This is achieved by interlinking multiple UTXOs, each containing snippets of code, to create extensive multi-stage protocols. This approach introduces on-chain computations and enables the execution of parallel actions within smart contracts.
This method offers functionality akin to Ethereum's accounts but without the associated overhead.
For additional insights, refer to the Multi-Stage Contracts in the UTXO Model (Paper) and (Video Presentation).

### Examples#
The concept is illustrated through various examples, including contracts for a Rock Paper Scissors game with provable fairness, a Reversible Address with anti-theft features, and a comprehensive ICO.
