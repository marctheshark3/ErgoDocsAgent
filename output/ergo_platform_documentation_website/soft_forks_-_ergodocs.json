  "summary": "A soft fork is a backward-compatible protocol update that introduces new rules or deactivates existing ones without requiring a hard fork. Soft forks allow the Ergo network to evolve and incorporate improvements while maintaining compatibility with non-upgraded nodes. This approach ensures a smooth transition and minimizes disruption to the network. Ergo's soft-fork mechanism is governed by a strict voting process that involves miners and unfolds over a series of epochs. The process is designed to ensure that protocol changes are introduced in a transparent and decentralized manner, with the support of a significant majority of the network.",

The process is designed to ensure that protocol changes are introduced in a transparent and decentralized manner, with the support of a significant majority of the network.\nThe soft-fork process consists of the following key stages:\nProposal: A soft-fork proposal is initiated by a miner, signaling the start of the voting process.\nVoting: The voting process spans multiple epochs, during which miners cast their votes for or against the proposed change.\nActivation: If the proposal secures the required support, an activation period begins, preparing the network for the implementation of the new protocol rules.\nImplementation: At the end of the activation period, the new protocol rules come into effect, and the network operates under the updated rules."

      "heading": "Preconditions for a Soft Fork#",
      "content": "Software Update: A protocol developer releases an updated version of the Ergo software that includes changes to existing rules or introduces new ones. This updated software version is made available to miners and nodes on the network.\nProposal: A soft-fork proposal is initiated when a miner includes a specific identifier (e.g., 120) in the first block of a new epoch, signaling the start of the voting process."

    {
      "heading": "Voting Process#",
      "content": "Duration: The voting process spans 32 epochs, each consisting of 1,024 blocks. The total voting period thus covers 32,768 blocks.\nThreshold: For a soft fork to be approved, it must receive at least 90% of the total votes, which equates to a minimum of 29,491 votes out of a possible 32,768.\nNegative Outcome: If the proposal fails to meet the 90% threshold, the voting process concludes, and new proposals can be initiated in the subsequent epoch.\nPositive Outcome: If the proposal secures the required votes, an activation period of 32 epochs begins immediately."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Activation and Implementation#",
      "content": "Activation Period: Following a successful vote, the network enters an activation phase that lasts for 32 epochs. During this period, the network prepares for the implementation of the new protocol rules.\nActivation Height: The first block following the activation period is referred to as the 'activation height.' It is at this point that the new protocol rules come into effect.\nBlock Versioning: The block version is updated in the extension sections starting from the first block of the activation period. However, the protocol version in the block headers is only updated at the activation height."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Technical Details#",
      "content": "Validation Rules and Soft-Fork Process: Specific validation rules in Ergo, as outlined in the ValidationRules.scala file, can be toggled or introduced during a soft-fork. These rules are flagged as mayBeDisabled, allowing the protocol to adapt to new requirements without breaking backward compatibility. For instance, the exCheckForkVote rule ensures that voting for a new fork is only permissible after the activation period of a previous soft-fork.\n\n\nBlock Generation and Soft-Fork Voting: The process of block generation in Ergo is tightly integrated with the soft-fork voting mechanism. As seen in the CandidateGenerator.scala file, blocks are generated with considerations for whether they should include votes for a soft-fork based on the current height and state context. This logic ensures that votes are accurately recorded and the network remains synchronized during the voting period.\n\n\nFork-Ordering Logic: The forkOrdered method plays a crucial role in determining whether the conditions for a soft-fork are met. This method checks the current block height, protocol version, and voting results to decide whether a soft-fork should proceed. This ensures that the network only moves forward with a soft-fork when all predefined conditions are satisfied."

      "heading": "Examples#",
      "content": "Starting a Vote: Assume a vote is proposed in block #1024 by including the identifier \"120\" in the extension section. If 500 votes are collected in that epoch, the next epoch's block (#2048) should include the pairs 122: 1024 (indicating the start height of the vote) and 121: 500 (indicating the votes collected).\n\n\nCounting Votes: If the next epoch (starting at block #2048) gathers an additional 600 votes, the block at height #3072 should include the updated pairs 121: 1100 and 122: 1024.\n\n\nVote Outcome: If the total votes collected between blocks #1024 and #33791 do not exceed 29,491, the vote fails, and new voting parameters can be initiated in the following epoch (starting at block #34816).\n\n\nVote Success and Activation: If the vote is successful, with more than 29,491 votes collected, the activation period begins immediately after block #33792. During the 32-epoch activation period, no new soft-fork proposals can be introduced. At the end of this period, the protocol version is updated in the block headers at the activation height, and the new rules take effect.\nFor more practical examples and a detailed discussion on soft-fork voting, refer to this Ergo Forum post."
