  "summary": "EFYT was systematically airdropped and then listed on the Waves DEX in May 2017, with an initial supply of 100,000 tokens. This launch aimed to build an early community around the platform and raise capital for development and marketing before launching the mainnet. EFYT vs ERG EFYT, which was issued on the Waves Platform, is a separate entity from ERG, the native token of the Ergo blockchain. ERG became available after the launch of the Ergo mainnet and could only be obtained through mining. For more information on Ergo's emission see this page The maximum supply of EFYT is capped at 1,970,945.0, mirroring 10% of Ergo's first-year token emission which corresponds to the amount of ERGs the Ergo Foundation recieved in this same period.",
