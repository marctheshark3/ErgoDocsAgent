Naive approaches to generate randomness can be manipulated by miners or observant attackers. Insecure randomness can be exploited by attackers to gain an unfair advantage in games, lotteries, or any other contracts that rely on random number generation.

      "heading": "The Commit-Reveal Protocol#",
      "content": "The Commit-Reveal protocol is a multi-party scheme for generating random numbers. It consists of two phases: commit and reveal. The protocol is described in detail on the ergo-randgen GitHub repository.\nCommit Phase: In this phase, each participant generates a random seed and calculates its corresponding hash value. They then submit a commitment that contains the hash of their answer and the random seed value. The smart contract stores these commitments on the blockchain.\n\n\nReveal Phase: In this phase, participants reveal their answer and the seed value.\nHere's how the protocol works:\nParty A generates a random number, randomA.\nParty A sends a message with the hash of randomA, hash(randomA). This commits Party A to the value randomA, as while no one can guess the value of randomA, once Party A provides it, everyone can verify its correctness.\nParty B sends a message with another random number, randomB.\nParty A reveals the value of randomA in a third message.\nBoth parties accept the random number as randomA ^ randomB, the exclusive OR (XOR) of the two values.\nThe advantage of using XOR is that the final random number is determined equally by both parties, ensuring that neither party can choose an advantageous \"random\" value.\nThe ergo-randgen GitHub repository provides a detailed implementation of the Commit-Reveal protocol for Ergo, including example transactions and workflows."
