This will help prevent address clashes with the mainnet and public testnet by using a custom addressPrefix and magicBytes.\n\n\n\nCompile the Node:\n\nUse the following command to compile the Ergo node:\n  sbt assembly\n\nThis will generate an ergo.jar file at /target/scala*/ergo-*.jar.\n\n\n\nRun the Node:\n\nStart the node using the command:\n  java -jar -Xmx4G ergo-*.jar --testnet -c testnet.conf\n\n\n\n\nInitialize and Unlock the Wallet:\n\nAccess the panel at 127.0.0.1:9052/panel to initialize and unlock your wallet. This is necessary as the first blocks will be generated using Autolykos v1."
