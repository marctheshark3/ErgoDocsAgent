      "content": "Addressing Early DEX Limitations: Spectrum Bloom aims to overcome issues such as lack of transparency, composability, and poor performance in early DEX implementations.\nDecentralization and Openness: The framework focuses on principles of decentralization, openness, transparency, and sustainability.\neUTxO Model: Utilizes the eUTxO blockchain model, as seen in Ergo and Cardano, supporting multi-stage contracts and multi-token functionality.\nInnovative DEX Protocol: Includes a novel protocol for DEX that consists of both on-chain (UTxO and validators) and off-chain (event handlers for state transitions) elements.\nLiquidity Pooling and Execution: Spectrum Bloom proposes unique approaches to liquidity pooling and order execution, aiming to streamline processes and reduce overhead.\nUniversal Order Composition: Introduces universally composable orders, which can be fulfilled from any liquidity source, enhancing flexibility and efficiency.\nAutonomous Account (AA): A key feature where an on-chain entity can validate execution and release user funds for trading, facilitating a dynamic set of applications on eUTxO blockchains.\nFuture Extensions and Applications: The white paper also discusses potential extensions and applications of the Autonomous Account concept beyond DEXes."
