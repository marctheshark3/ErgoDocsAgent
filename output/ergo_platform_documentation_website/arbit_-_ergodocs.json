The platform identifies opportunities where a user can buy and sell tokens across different decentralized exchanges to make a profit.\nSupported Tokens: ERG, ADA, and RSN.\nSupported Exchanges: Ergo Dex and Splash.\n\nCore Features:\n\nPredefined arbitrage strategies (called \"Arbits\").\nFocus on simplicity and usability.\nExecution of swaps with just a few clicks.\nWhat is an Arbit?\nAn Arbit is a series of swaps that generate profit. For example:\nSell 100 X tokens on Exchange A for $100.\nBuy 105 Y tokens on Exchange B for the same $100.\nProfit from the additional 5 Y tokens."
