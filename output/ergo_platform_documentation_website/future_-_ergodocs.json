This has led to the vibrant ecosystem we see today, with: As time progresses, the Ergo Foundation's importance should diminish, and responsibility should transition towards the community. This shift is essential for the ecosystem's strength and decentralization. The Ergo Foundation may continue to exist indefinitely as a legal entity, primarily serving to mitigate counterparty risk in interactions with centralized entities.

This has led to the vibrant ecosystem we see today, with:\nOver 300 community developers\nMore than 100 active contributors in the weekly developer chat on Discord\nHosting multiple events annually\nOver 140 projects developing on Ergo (see sigmaverse.io for an overview)\nConsistently ranked among the top 100 for development activity on artemis.xyz"

This shift is essential for the ecosystem's strength and decentralization.\nThe Ergo Foundation may continue to exist indefinitely as a legal entity, primarily serving to mitigate counterparty risk in interactions with centralized entities. In the interim, it will continue to foster the development of applications and protocols that align with its foundational objectives:\nPromoting blockchain technology for societal benefit\nAdvocating for truly decentralized infrastructure\nUpholding privacy as a fundamental human right\nThe optimal strategy involves diligent work and the development of robust infrastructure to accommodate potential liquidity shifts from existing systems. Emphasis should be placed on user security, privacy, and long-term resilience. While the timing and nature of these shifts cannot be precisely predicted or controlled, strategic positioning can prepare us for various outcomes.\nThe generous contributions from ecosystem projects to the Foundation's treasury ensure its sustainability, enabling it to fulfill this mission until it becomes redundant."
