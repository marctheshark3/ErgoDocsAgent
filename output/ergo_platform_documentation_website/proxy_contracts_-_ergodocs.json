  "summary": "Proxy contracts are a specific smart contract pattern used on Ergo. They act as intermediaries, allowing users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) in a controlled and secure manner, especially in scenarios where direct wallet-dApp communication might be complex or limited. The concept gained prominence with tools like the Ergo Assembler. This enabled early dApps such as Ergo Auction House, ErgoUtils, and the SigmaUSD web interface to function effectively even before the widespread availability of wallet connectors similar to Ethereum's MetaMask. Proxy contracts essentially provide a secure \"spending script\" that users can send funds to.",

    {
      "heading": "Key Design Principles#",
      "content": "When designing or interacting with proxy contracts, developers and users should prioritize security:\nFund Safety: The contract logic must rigorously prevent the dApp developer, the proxy contract creator, or any third party from misappropriating the user's funds. The contract should only allow spending according to the dApp's intended logic and the user's explicit action.\ndApp Integrity: The proxy contract should not introduce new attack vectors. It must protect against manipulation that could compromise the underlying dApp's state or logic (e.g., preventing replay attacks or unexpected state changes)."
