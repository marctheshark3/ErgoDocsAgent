With the successful integration of UTXO set snapshots and Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work (NiPoPoWs) for ultra-fast bootstrapping in the pruned full node, our focus has now shifted towards optimizing this implementation. We are also exploring ways to further increase block limits for miners, given the live status of the pruned full node. Summarised from Kushti, 7 Aug, 2023",
