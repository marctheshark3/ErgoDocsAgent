To alleviate some performance issues on later blocks, you can lower the default maxConnections from 30 to 10 in your ergo.conf: This makes the sync process slower but it should run more smoothly.

      "heading": "Timeouts or Unresponsiveness Under Load#",
      "content": "Symptoms:\nAPI requests (e.g., from your wallet, dApp backend, or scripts) take a very long time to respond or fail with timeout errors.\nThe node's web panel (/panel) might become slow or unresponsive.\nThis often occurs when the node is handling multiple concurrent API requests or processing large amounts of data.\nPotential Causes & Solutions:\nInsufficient JVM Memory: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running the node might not have enough allocated memory (heap space) to handle the load efficiently, leading to excessive garbage collection pauses or out-of-memory situations.\n\nCheck: Monitor the node's memory usage using system tools (like htop, Task Manager) or JVM monitoring tools if available. Look for high memory usage approaching the allocated limit.\nSolution: Increase the maximum heap size allocated to the JVM using the -Xmx flag in your node startup command. For example, if you are running with -Xmx4G, try increasing it to -Xmx6G or -Xmx8G (ensure your system has enough physical RAM).\n    # Example startup command with increased memory:\njava -jar -Xmx6G ergo-*.jar --mainnet -c ergo.conf\n\nRestart the node after changing the -Xmx value.\n\n\n\nHigh System Load: The server running the node might be overloaded due to other processes consuming CPU, RAM, or disk I/O. Check overall system resource usage.\n\n\nNode Mode Limitations: Certain node modes (like Digest mode) might have inherent limitations in handling specific API queries that require scanning the full UTXO set, potentially leading to slower responses for those queries. Refer to the Node Modes documentation.\n\n\nNetwork Latency: Slow network connections between your client application and the node can also contribute to perceived timeouts.\n\n\nSpecific API Endpoint Issues: Occasionally, a specific API endpoint might have a bug or inefficiency causing performance problems. Check the Ergo Node GitHub Issues for reports related to the endpoint you're using."

      "heading": "Issues with Public Nodes & Explorers#",
      "content": "While running your own node provides the most control and trust, many users rely on public infrastructure (nodes and explorers) for convenience or when running a personal node isn't feasible.\nKnown Public Resources (Community-Run, Status May Vary):\nNode Lists:\nergonodes.net: Provides a list of public nodes with basic status monitoring.\n\n\nExplorers (Often provide public API access):\nexplorer.ergoplatform.com (Official)\nergexplorer.com\nsigmaspace.io\nergobackup.aap.cornell.edu (May primarily be a backup service, check API availability)\n\n\n(Note: This list is not exhaustive and uptime/reliability are not guaranteed. Always verify the trustworthiness and status of a public service before relying on it for critical operations.)\nTroubleshooting Public Infrastructure Issues:\nIf you encounter problems with a public node or explorer (e.g., incorrect data, API timeouts, connectivity problems, website errors):\nTry Alternatives: The simplest first step is to switch your wallet or application to use a different public node/explorer from the lists above or other known community resources. The issue might be specific to the service you were initially using.\nCheck Service Status:\nFor nodes listed on ergonodes.net, check their reported status (height, sync status).\nCheck the explorer website itself for any status banners or announcements.\nLook in community channels (Discord, Telegram) for recent reports about the specific service.\n\n\nIdentify the Operator (If Possible): Some public services are run by known community projects or individuals. If you can identify the operator, check their specific project channels (Discord, Telegram, GitHub) for status updates or to report issues.\nReport in General Community Channels: If the operator is unknown or the issue seems widespread, report the problem in general Ergo community support channels (like the #node or relevant dApp/wallet channels on Discord). Provide clear details:\nThe IP address or URL of the public node/explorer.\nThe specific issue..."
