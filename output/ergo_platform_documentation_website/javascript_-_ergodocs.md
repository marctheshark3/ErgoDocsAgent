## Summary
JavaScript and TypeScript developers can interact with the Ergo blockchain using various libraries and frameworks. Notably, JS/TS bindings for sigma-rust (via WebAssembly) provide core blockchain interaction capabilities. Appkit was designed as an abstraction layer on top of Sigma. This gives a lot of freedom on the core level in Sigma, while keeping dApp-facing APIs stable. With the availability of Sigma.js, Fleet can play the same role for JS/TS.
