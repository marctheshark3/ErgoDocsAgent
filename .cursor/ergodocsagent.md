Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Documentation Processing AI Agent
1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for an AI agent designed to automate the processing of documentation from specified sources, such as GitHub repositories and websites. The agent will extract key information, transform it into a format optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) or AI agents, generate new documentation resources, and operate on a periodic schedule. The solution will be developed using the Cursor AI code editor, leveraging Python and relevant libraries.
2. Goals and Objectives
The primary goals of the AI agent are to:

Ingest documentation from diverse sources, including GitHub repositories (e.g., Ergo Platform’s documentation at ErgoDocs) and websites (e.g., Ergo Platform Docs).
Extract essential information using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Rewrite or structure the information to enhance its usability for LLMs or AI agents.
Generate a comprehensive set of new documentation files based on the processed information.
Enable periodic execution, such as weekly, to keep documentation updated.
Provide flexibility to process multiple sources for various use cases, allowing easy configuration.

3. Features and Functionality
3.1 Source Ingestion

GitHub Repositories: The agent will clone or download documentation files from specified GitHub repositories, handling formats like Markdown or text.
Websites: The agent will crawl websites to extract text content from relevant pages, respecting site structure and robots.txt.
Configuration: Users can specify source URLs via a configuration file or command-line arguments.

3.2 Information Extraction

Parse documentation to identify and extract key information, such as headings, summaries, or technical details.
Use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy or Hugging Face transformers) to summarize content or extract structured data like function descriptions or API endpoints.

3.3 Transformation

Transform extracted information into an LLM-friendly format, which may include:
Concise summaries of complex sections.
Structured data (e.g., JSON with key-value pairs or question-answer formats).
Simplified language for better LLM comprehension.


Leverage the OpenAI API for advanced text processing, such as rewriting or generating structured outputs.

3.4 Documentation Generation

Create new documentation files (e.g., Markdown, PDFs) based on transformed content.
Organize outputs into a logical structure, such as a knowledge base or a set of topic-specific documents.
Ensure generated files are accessible and well-formatted for both human and AI use.

3.5 Periodic Execution

Schedule the agent to run automatically, e.g., weekly, using a Python scheduling library like APScheduler.
Support manual triggers for on-demand processing.

3.6 Flexibility and Scalability

Allow users to add or remove sources without significant code changes.
Support processing multiple repositories or websites in a single run.
Enable customization of output formats and transformation rules via configuration.

4. User Stories



User Story
Description



As a developer, I want to process Ergo Platform’s documentation weekly so that I have up-to-date, LLM-optimized resources.
The agent fetches documentation from ErgoDocs, extracts key information, transforms it, and generates new files on a schedule.


As a project manager, I want to apply the agent to multiple repositories so that I can compile resources for different projects.
The agent accepts a list of source URLs and processes them in a single run, producing tailored documentation.


As an AI researcher, I want the documentation in a structured format so that my LLM can query it effectively.
The agent outputs JSON files with question-answer pairs or summaries suitable for LLM training or retrieval.


5. Technical Requirements

Programming Language: Python 3.8+ for compatibility and library support.
Libraries:
GitPython for GitHub repository interactions.
BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for web scraping.
spaCy or Hugging Face transformers for NLP tasks.
OpenAI API for text summarization and transformation.
APScheduler for scheduling periodic runs.
Markdown or PDF generation libraries (e.g., python-markdown, ReportLab).


Development Environment: Cursor AI code editor, utilizing its AI-powered code suggestions and completions.
Deployment: The agent can run on a local server or cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) with scheduling capabilities.
Dependencies: Ensure compatibility with standard Python package managers (e.g., pip).

6. Implementation Plan

Environment Setup:
Configure Cursor with Python and required libraries.
Set up a project structure with configuration files for source URLs.


Development:
Implement source ingestion for GitHub and websites.
Develop NLP-based extraction and OpenAI API integration for transformation.
Create modules for generating documentation files.
Integrate APScheduler for periodic execution.


Testing:
Test each component (ingestion, extraction, transformation, generation, scheduling) individually.
Perform end-to-end testing with sample sources like ErgoDocs.


Deployment:
Deploy the script on a server or cloud platform.
Configure scheduling and monitor execution logs.



7. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Process a single repository or website within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 10 minutes for a medium-sized repository).
Scalability: Handle multiple sources without significant performance degradation.
Reliability: Include error handling for network issues, invalid URLs, or API rate limits.
Usability: Provide clear configuration options and documentation for users to specify sources and output preferences.

8. Assumptions and Constraints

Assumptions:
Documentation is primarily in text-based formats (e.g., Markdown, HTML).
The OpenAI API provides sufficient capabilities for text transformation.
Users have basic Python knowledge to configure and run the script.


Constraints:
Dependent on third-party APIs (e.g., OpenAI, GitHub), which may have rate limits or costs.
Web scraping must comply with website terms of service and robots.txt.



9. Prompt for Cursor
To streamline development in Cursor, the following prompt can be used to guide its AI in generating the Python script:
"I am building a Python script to automate the processing of documentation from sources like GitHub repositories (e.g., https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergodocs) or websites (e.g., https://docs.ergoplatform.com/). The script should:

Fetch Documentation: Clone GitHub repositories using GitPython or scrape websites using BeautifulSoup.
Extract Information: Use NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy) to parse and summarize content.
Transform Content: Use the OpenAI API to rewrite or structure content for LLMs (e.g., summaries, JSON).
Generate Files: Create new Markdown or PDF files with transformed content.
Schedule Runs: Use APScheduler to run the script weekly.
Support Multiple Sources: Allow configuration of multiple source URLs.

Please guide me through writing this script step-by-step. Start by setting up the project environment, installing libraries (GitPython, BeautifulSoup, openai, spacy, APScheduler), and implementing source ingestion for a GitHub repository."
10. Conclusion
This PRD provides a comprehensive blueprint for developing an AI agent that meets the requirements for processing and transforming documentation. By leveraging Cursor’s AI capabilities and the provided prompt, developers can efficiently build a flexible and scalable solution tailored to LLM and AI agent needs.
Additional Notes on LLM-Optimized Documentation
Preparing documentation for LLMs involves transforming content into formats that enhance comprehension or usability, such as:

Structured Data: JSON or YAML with key-value pairs (e.g., function names and descriptions).
Question-Answer Pairs: Formats suitable for training or fine-tuning LLMs.
Concise Summaries: Simplified text to reduce processing overhead.
Embeddings: Vector representations for similarity search (optional, depending on use case).

The exact format depends on the intended LLM application (e.g., knowledge base, retrieval-augmented generation). This PRD assumes a general approach, producing summaries and structured data, but can be refined based on specific needs.
